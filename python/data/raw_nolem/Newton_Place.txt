i 've been to hk a couple of times already , and i will totally not recommend this hotel especially if you 're traveling with children or older people due to it 's location-unless of course if your purpose of travel is just within the area , then u ought to be in this hotel. the hotel 's location is too far from almost everything ! even the nearest MTR station that is the only reasonable thing that could get u around the whole of HK would require a lot of your energy to get there. would be nice to do the walking of course , good for everyone 's health , but when you 're on a strict schedule , especially tourists , who would n't wan na miss a second of their time , this is not the place for you !

having been to HK several times already , we made it a point to stay in the area of Tsim Sha Tsui , Central and Wanchai. This time , due to time restraints , the only available hotel that we were able to book is in the Kwun Tong district. Yes , the Newton Place Hotel is just over a year old...nice facilities for a 3-star hotel but the location is not convenient for tourists. I would not recommend this hotel for those travelling with kids and for those who intend to visit HK for shopping .

my husband and I just returned from a 5 day 4 night stay at the Newton Place Hotel. Even if the hotel is somewhat far from the tourist area , Hongkong has a very efficient MTR. Newton Place is in an industrialized area with not much to see and do but it is compensated by its clean rooms and surroundings. It has very helpful and courteous staff. The hotel provides free shuttle service to a few malls nearby and to Harbour City very near the Star Ferry .

my family stayed there for 3 nites and it was fun. Our room is overlooking the old airport. Location is just fine since everything in hk is accessible. The mtr and the bus , mall. 7 11. is just a few blocks away. Though its located at an industrial zone , hotel is clean is roomy .
