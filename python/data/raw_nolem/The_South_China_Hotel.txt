take the bus from airport , will drop you directly at hotel doorstep second last stop . The room is small , well compared to other HK hotel for this price is okay. There are 5 of us in this trip so is rather waste to rent another room all by myself , we added a bed which cost 200 per night but when the time we check out 3 day later it only charge me for one night....haha
