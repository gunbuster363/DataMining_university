the room is tiny , but the location is superb , close to everything. Perfect for solo traveller .

location and size is ok it you consider about the price... I booked one week via www.ctrip.com and when I checked in they told me that they had upgraded me to deluxe room... Great ! ! ! But the room was the same only higher floor .

no complaints on this one. Not a place for someone who cant sleep in traffic sounds , but you get the excellent central location for reasonable price on the other side. Free inroom internet connection is also a plus .

we â € ˜ ve just returned from our 2 week trip to HK &amp ; Thailand. We stayed 3 nights at Walden Hotel and for the price we paid and what was included ; the hotel was n't as bad as the previous poster mentioned. We were 3 adults and paid for an extra cot .

we arrived at this hotel and realized that we were being robbed. The &quot ; deluxe&quot ; rooms were simply tiny rooms located on higher floors. For 300 USD a night , we had a room , that with an extra bed had little room to walk. The &quot ; view&quot ; from this expensive room was junky. We were shocked at what we had reserved and decided to pack-up and leave and head to the airport two days early. The desk staff had little to say , other than contact booking agent and tell them. The &quot ; standard&quot ; rate was not available. Their solution was to give us three rooms and waive the extra cot fee. This solution would cost of 800 USD a night for two rooms , instead of 600 USD. They were unwilling to accomodate us in any way. Although this is a clean , tidy little room in a convenient location , the prices are way overblown. I say , run for your life and do n't let the websiter fool you .
