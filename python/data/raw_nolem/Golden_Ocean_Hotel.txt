the Golden Ocean Hotel has great location , is in the centre of Kowloon , which is great for shopping ; The Tsim Sha Tsui MTR and the airport bus are a just a few steps from the door. The room is a bit small but it is very clean. The Owner is very helpful , and the hotel has many services for tourists , such as maps , hot water , scales , free internet and laptop use. I highly recommend this hotel to other budget families wishing to stay in Hong Kong
