the hotel be mildly average . the rooms seem a little fade and the bed be terribly hard . i find flush the toilet incredibly hard and a little strange , as we have to wait   minutes before we be able to flush . still , there be some good things . there be internet in the lobby and check in be fast . it 's quite a small hotel . if you want to come to hong kong , i would recommend stay in kowloon or in the city of hong kong to feel the magic of hk . unfortunately , the hotel be n't in the magic of hong kong . i would recommend this hotel for people stop by in hk or budget traveler

a nice , clean , relatively small hotel , and great for budget watchers . not centrally locate , but streetcar tram stop right out in front , and from there it 's only   minutes or so to mtr subway rapid transit . free internet access in the lobby be a plus . rooms , at least those in the back , be pretty quiet

the cosco be a good standard , good value hotel in the western side of hk island . you can reach the centre , lkf and everywhere else quite easily on the tram for   penny   hk dollar , which take about   minutes or so

i would like to to say that i have a fantastic week in hong kong with the aid of a rough guide to hong kong
