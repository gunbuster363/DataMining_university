we stay at the sohotel for   night while travel on business . while the room be a bit tight for two people travel with large luggage stand in the center of the room , i could spread my arms and just almost touch the wall with both hands , the location be more than ideal for us . the proximity to the sheung wan metro be within   minutes walk depend on how long you have to wait to cross a street without risk your life ! , and the macau ferry terminal be just on the otherside of the metro tunnel . the location make it very easy for us to travel through out the city , and also take a quick day trip over to macau . it be also within a quick walk to lan kwai , soho , man mo temple , cat st . and hollywood rd

sandwich between tall building along the western stretch of bonham strand , it be easy to miss sohotel if one be just walk by the establishment . with a cool , collect design for its entrance , this little pearl embed in the sheung wan district of hk island sparkle in the night when all the surround abalone seafood shop have shut their shutter
