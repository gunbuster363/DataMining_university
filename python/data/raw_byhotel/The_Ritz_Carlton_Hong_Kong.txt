my husband and i stay in the honeymoon suite for our honeymoon   for five night at the end of a long backpack experience in china . we absolutely enjoy it   outstanding , thus i be sad that it have be demolish consider we be hope to return for another five night stay on our fifth wed anniversary . the beautiful cocktail in the opulent lounge listen to the live jazz band be one of our happiest memories . the staff be absolutely beautiful . i buy many special item from the gift shop too which be a wonderful reminder of our honeymoon . the ritz also start my obsession with bvlgari toiletries   with an unlimited supply in our beautiful bathroom   how could one not fall in love with it ! i look forward to stay at the new ritz

how can rewiews continue to come in for recent stay at the ritz carlton hong kong , when that property in central close on january   ,   , and the former site be redevelop into high rise office space

the rooms be way too small . could barely fit   with all our luggage . the bed can sleep only one , they 're bigger than twin but smaller than queen and there be almost no space for an extra bed

ritz carlton hong kong have be demolish for over   years . how be it possible for review of stay as late as july  

along with the chedi in muscat , the best hotel i have ever stay in . what more can i say . a perfect stay in all regard
