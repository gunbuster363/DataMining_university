we stayed at the Sohotel for 4 nights while traveling on business. While the room was a bit tight for two people traveling with large luggage standing in the center of the room , I could spread my arms and just almost touch the walls with both hands , the location was more than ideal for us. The proximity to the Sheung Wan metro was within 6 minutes walk depending on how long you had to wait to cross a street without risking your life ! , and the Macau ferry terminal is just on the otherside of the metro tunnel. The location made it very easy for us to travel through out the city , and also take a quick day trip over to Macau. It is also within a quick walk to Lan Kwai , SoHo , Man Mo Temple , Cat St. and Hollywood Rd .

sandwiched between tall buildings along the western stretch of Bonham Strand , it is easy to miss SoHotel if one was just walking by the establishment. With a cool , collected design for its entrance , this little pearl embedded in the Sheung Wan District of HK island sparkles in the night when all the surrounding abalone/seafood shops have shut their shutters .
