you pay for what you get I guess...the rooms were tiny , the AC was too strong and uncontrolable , and the beds were so hard and you could feel EVRY spring. Awful ! Worst beds on this planet. The only positive was the great location in Causway Bay .

the rooms are small , but it is a hostel , not hotel. You can have private bathroom , so basically it is like a hotel , only tiny rooms .

the room I stayed in was small and dirty. Its located on the edge of a big shopping area but a couple subway stops away from the main shopping and tourist area. The staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Most of the staff are not able to speak English and if they can it is very limited. This was strange because most of the other people I encountered in Hong Kong spoke English very well .
