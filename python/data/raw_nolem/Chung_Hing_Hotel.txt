we stayed at Novotel across the road for a couple of days and the room was so small and stunk of smoke. We then went to Chung Hing across the road to see what it was like. Yes it is an older building , but it 's cosy. We stayed on the 13th floor. The room had great views , clean bathroom , comfortable bed. I am not sure why the other reviewers state that it was unacceptable and unclean. We found it clean , comfortable , awesome views and great location. Good little eateries next door too for lunch. Highly recommend this place. Enjoy .

this hotel is one to avoid. The hotel rooms and public areas smell heavily of smoke. The room was small , dusty and smelt strongly of cigarettes. The pillows on the bed had a bad smell as if they had not been washed. The bathroom was not very clean and smelt of urine. Fortunately only stayed one night on a short package tour to China and Hong Kong. On making representation to hotel management about the problems , quite frankly the management did not want to know and were noisy and unsympathetic. The only good thing is its excellent locaton .

hi,

we stayed there 3 nights with 2 rooms and we felt that it 's without air in all of 2 rooms. We had to open window and it become okay and better. Inside of 2 rooms were not smell of cigarette. We stayed 3 people in a room and extra bed could n't sleep. The elevator always strong cigarette smell everydays as well as no smoking written. The size of rooms are small and narrow. Water 's also some smell but it 's so good strong. Service is okay and location is good to close with Jordan station MTR .

i have had a bad experience while at Hong Kong recently and I ca n't helped but felt cheated by the tour agent !
