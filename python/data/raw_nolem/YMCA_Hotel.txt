located in the centre of things and next door to the 'Peninsular ' , one of the best hotels in the world , the YMCA Salisbury Hotel , does n't look very impressive , however , looks can be deceiving .

i enjoyed my stay at the Salisbury YMCA. Granted it could do with an update but it was fine for me. You only use your room to sleep in so it served the purpose. It was clean and comfortable .
