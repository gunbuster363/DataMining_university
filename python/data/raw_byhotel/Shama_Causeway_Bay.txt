just complete my vacation at shama causeway bay from   dec . must say that i be quietly impress by the efficiency and friendliness of the establishment range from the manager randy and his staff esp the concierge sorry but cant remember his name . the room be spacious and plesantly decored and the bathroom be deck out with bvlgari bottle of liquid soap , shampoo , conditioner etc

i have stay in a lot of hotel in hong kong range from mid to high end and shama causeway bay be definitely one of the best i have stay in when you consider their location , price , and the size of their rooms . shama be more of a service apartment hotel so it would be an even better choice if you be stay for long periods . its situate right opposite of times square where there be shopping , food , nightlife , and the taxis and the mtr 's be just right infront of you when you walk out

although not luxe in the way a grand hyatt or other name brand   hotel would be , the shama service apartment be luxurious in that they be wonderfully spacious   especially so in land scarce hong kong , where hotel rooms and apt home be usually tiny and cramped . our fully air conditioned   bdrm apt be almost   sq ft in size , and come with a large walk in closet what a rarity ! . the bathroom , live area and bedroom be also very spacious , something larger built westerner would surely appreciate . there be also nice thoughtful touch provide , such as bulgari toiletry , good quality bedroom slipper which a lot of   hotel compromise on , similarly good quality bed and linen , and even a bose sound system . there be also free cable tv and broadband , and even an ipod station by the bed

just opposite time square , this be a great place to stay if you want to eat and shop with ease . we travel with a baby and a toddler , and enjoy our stay very much . the hotel staff be all very helpful . the size of the apartment be decent and it contain all the little things that make it seem like a home away from home
