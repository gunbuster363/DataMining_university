last leg of our Macau-Hongkong trip. We moved from Dorsett Hotel in Tsuen wan , due to distance barrier to the city centre , In locating the place , we already had a hard time and Was terribly shocked by the atmosphere and the accommodation , Believe it or not , the 3 nite stay we reserved and paid for in advance , ca n't convince us to stay , though we entered our room , and suddenly decided to pack our bags and leave... Better to stay at home , rather than staying here in this junk hostel... Be very wary , with fire exits , the place is so crowded , you might mistook this for a market place , though we are aware that hongkong rooms are relatively small. .
