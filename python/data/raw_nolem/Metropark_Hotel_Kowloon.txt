either someone messed up with the rating or I was duped by my agent ! The only good thing about this hotel is its location , which is near to one of the most popular shopping area in Kowloon called Ladies Market. My take on this hotel :

i based my choice of hotel on location and tried to minimise walking during the evenings. Be aware that there are 2 Metroparks in the Mongkok area. I got it a bit wrong ! The Metropark Mongkok is north of the main shopping area close the the Prince Edward MTR and the other one is the Metropark Kowloon with is on Waterloo Rd and quite a walk to the Mongkok MTR. So if you plan on using the MTR much in HK it 's a good idea then be sure your hotel is close to a station .

the hotel was lovely - just a shame it was so far from hong kong harbour. the traffic is murder and rush hour. the hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the shopping area and the harbour every half hour. there is a sightseeing tour desk within the hotel , where the staff was very helpful. plenty for everyone at the breakfast buffet. the swimming pool was warm and great

our good experience with this hotel started a week before we arrived when I asked by e-mail for baby cot. I was replied promptly with a confirmation even though they did not yet received my booking , this is nice. The staff proceeded to be nice and helpful throughout our stay .

what a wonderful Hotel , the cleanliness was first class , the food was excellent and the staff could not do enough for you , there is a free bus down to the harbour and the last one returns at 11 pm .

hotel is conveniently located ,about 15 minutes Cab from Victoria and well connected by Hotel Bus form International airport and with local bus /taxi services at doorstep .

stayed for 6 days with my daughter and granddaughter and the staff were excellent. The room was a twin bed with an extra bed .

having stayed in Hong Kong a few times over the years we thought we would give this hotel a chance. The hotel and staff can not be criticised , the room was excellent as was the service. The room was clean and in good condition , we stayed in a refurbished room on the 6th floor and had a spacious comfort room which was a really good size. The shuttle bus was a god send however more than once we were turned away as it was full and found we had to come down and sit in the bus more than 15 minutes before it was due to leave , often with the air conditioning turned off ! Although the hotel can not be faulted next time we will be staying on Hong Kong island , almost definitely with the same chain .

this hotel is part of the Chinese Metropark group , and having stayed in the Metropark in Xiamen I was a bit disappointed with the size of the room here , but perhaps that 's just the way things are in Hong Kong. Otherwise the hotel had been recently refurbished you sank into the corridor carpet and was generally a pleasant place to stay. The beds are soft by Chinese standards. Good choice of TV channels inc BBC world .

a lovely hotel in a good location. Friendly staff , exceptionally clean , great breakfast &amp ; good value .

our stay at the Metropark was great. The room was a little small but it was very clean , comfortable and probably the going size for Hong Kong. The buffet breakfast each morning was delicious with good choices to suit everyone 's tastes. Although it is a bit off the main area , the hotel shuttle bus was excellent and frequent so we never felt stranded. Monkok shopping area and markets were within easy walking distance as was Monkok MTR station. All the staff were friendly and helpful and could n't do enough when one of our companions was sick and needed a doctor. We would most definately stay there again if we go back to Hong Kong .

i picked this hotel because it seemed to be good value at a reasonable price. I was n't quite clear on quite where Kowloon was in relation to Hong Kong Island. Its a bus trip for most people , but the hotel operates a free bus service , so its no issue , and its quite close to Mong Kok. There is also a Tour Operator Day trips etc thats based at the Hotel , so getting out and about is easy and safe .

good price and quite spacious for an Aisan hotel. Clean with adequate space. The furniture is dated but ok. Also got to get use to a harder bed since it is in Asia. Service was ok but not excellent. Location is in an older area but still quite safe and conveniently located near lots of bus and subway stations. Makes traveling to Hong Kong Island another places easy. Walking distance to Lady Street , Mong Kowk and a few other things. Resturants , cafe 's , bakeries and laundry facilities near by if you 'll be there for a bit. We were there for 1 week and do n't regret it. Not a romantic place but great if you 're going to be out most of the day and just need a place to stay. Free website was good. The pictures on the website are probably of rooms that have been recently renovated as ours did n't look as nice. The pool was also very small , especially for having been renovated recently. All in all , we do n't regret going there. I 'd recommend it if you 're not picky and not looking for a romatic/elgegant place .

the hotel just does not look impressive from the outside....but the minute you step in and into the rooms , u really begin to like it .

we stayed in this Metropark for two weeks in November 2008 , with another couple who having stayed there in Nov.2007 , recommended it to us. Our stay here,in a Club Room , helped to make our visit a truly memorable occasion. We found all the staff members we came into contact with during our stay to be very friendly and extremely helpful. Our breakfasts in the Club Lounge were first class and pleasantly varied.We particularly enjoyed the Congee. Our only other meals taken frequently in the hotel were in the SipSip bar and we both enjoyed all our meals there especially the Fish and Chips to die for and the Nasi Goreng ! ! The shuttle bus was a real bonus as was the Airport transfer. Locally we used the Wellcome supermarket across the street the 7/11 just to your right on leaving the hotel and carrying on a bit further the first laundry on the corner gave an excellent service at a bargain price.The staff in the nearby Watsons Chemist to the right were very helpful. We found that getting and using the Octupus card was a great tip and we would recomend using the MTR as often as possible { much easier and more friendly than the London Underground } and with stops near every place you are likely to go. I should also mention that we used Theresa 's cafe Chinese with English menus and food and service that belies the external looks ! I will say that we are going back to Hong Kong and the Metropark for 28 days,later this year. Our Niece stayed here for 4 days in June 2009 on her way to Australia and as a single female traveller thoroughly enjoyed her stay here. We would really like to thank all the staff of the Metropole for making us so welcome but especially Anita Hung , Raymond Catering Manager and all the girls in the SipSip Bar particularly Win Win Bar Captain and Mirra and also our Room Keeper .

from the outside , the Metropark Kowloon does n't harbour anything interesting. It sinks into the background of Kowloon with the rest of the terraced buildings that seem to mirror each other throughout the area .

stayed here a couple of nights en-route to Perth WA. All in all good service but the breakfast buffet was a bit crowded and they were slow to top up items that were missing from the buffet. The in house bar was was pricey so use the seven/eleven down the road to the right if you want bottled water etc. Room was clean , a bit small but had all the usual things you would expect , iron , hair dryer etc .

my sister and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and got a fantastic deal through hotels.ca. From the airport we took the airport express and arrived at Kowloon station , from there we took the free airport hotel shuttle bus K5 which takes you directly to the hotel , both of which were excellent .

take the upgrade to the Metropark Club Floor. Bigger room , personalised service , specialised check-in , turn down service , breakfast included and more. Great value hotel for Hong Kong. MTR less than 10 mins walk , Mongkok , Mongkok East , giving access to Kowloon , Hong Kong Island , and more. Close to the Mongkok Markets , Goldfish , Ladies , Computer Market etc , and Nathan Road. Good offers in the 'house ' restaurants. Would recommend to friends , and will use again .

my Wife and I stayed at the Metro Park Hotel on Waterloo Rd , the service and cleanliness of the hotel was worth its money. Its is cetainly worth while upgrading when you arrive. A courtsy bus is porvided and makes geting about a lot easier. 5Star

we stayed 4 nights and although the room was small it was clean and all we really needed. The Hotel ran a shuttle bus which we used on numerous occasions and found it very good as would have been a fortune in taxis to and from the harbour front .

just got back from my trip in HK. I stayed here during my last 3 nights , and despite the location , i must say i do n't regret my stay here at all !

stayed one night here after 2 nights at Novotel Kowloon. In terms of location , it is quite poorly located - nothing to do within walking distance , no place to shop and limited places to eat. Made up greatly by free hotel shuttle to Mongkok 20 minutes by foot and New World Place skip this place , waste of time .

this was a very good value for money hotel.The breakfast was especially good .

i and my lovely wife stayed at this property for only one night after having tried a hostel in the world- in famous Chongking Mansion a must , really ! : D . We were looking for something cheap , and this hotel was quite cheap by HK standards. But that 's all. It gave us a US-motel feeling , nothing much. At the time it seemed a big change from the place we stayed at at the &quot ; Mansion&quot ; , but now , thinking about it carefully , well... it was n't that good at all !

we stayed at Metropark for 3 nights en-route to Australia. The hotel is situated in kowloon and is in the middle of the built up area so no real views of any note from the hotel. We were two adults and a child 11years booked into a standard room .

what a nice hotel. staff where really friendly and helpful. The room was a bit small but very very nice. Was more like a 4 * hotel than just a 3. They need to re * this. Lol restaurant was stunning. Pool was clean and same as the gym. Free shuttle to the town / harbour area as well as back to the airport. Was a truly great end to our round the world trip .

stayed 4 nights mid August. Hotel basically sound. Rooms on small side but well furnished and no complaints. Stayed on Exec floor - incl breakfast , business centre and light food/drink each evening. Would have appreciated more selection and daytime tea/coffee etc .

arrived here at the beginning of our honeymoon and was n't sure what to expect. I knew we would n't be getting panoramic views of the harbour , but then we did n't want to be stuck in our room just looking out of the window !

we stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel is located in a more traditional area of Hong Kong , so do n't go expecting it to be too western. However , close proximity to metro lines and taxis were easy to get hold of .

thankyou Metropark hotel , for a lovely stay in your hotel , this is my forth stay in your hotel over the past 4 year. Your rooms are clean and tidy , the swimming pool attendant lady is very contientious with testing the pool regularly and to attending to the guests needs. Your front desk are very helpfully and knowledgeable regarding Hong Kong. But my most gratitude must go to Eric the deputy manager , who was the perfect host. Once again thankyou Eric and staff at the Metropark for making my stay in your hotel so enjoyable

hotel looks impressive on entry and the location is n't too bad with two MTR stations nearby plus free use of a shuttle bus .

stayed at Metropark Kowloon. Took the Airport Express train to HK then the free shuttle direct to the hotel. Check in was efficient and we were upgraded to a Club Room. Room was renovated with LCD screen , contemporary decor etc. Happy with the upgrade. Walls though were a bit thin. We had a connecting room and our neighbour was certainly not happy with the din we made at night !

i stayed here from 1st-5th Aug 09 ! the location is ok not very touristy but all signs and directions are in english and mcdonalds is a 5min walk and MTR is 10-15mins away ! ! !

i stayed here with my brother in September 2008 for 5 nights and we enjoyed our stay at the Metropark Hotel Kowloon. For the record we did NOT stay on the Club-floor but in a standard room .

we stayed just as swine flu was gathering pace and all staff were wearing masks. At check in we had our temperature taken ! One of the sister hotels had been quaranteed .

comfort Room

hotel was as we expected. Not the tops , but more than adequate for our 3 day stay .

this was my second stay at the Metropark Kowloon and I highly recommend it. The rooms are not huge but are well laid oot. Yes yes I thought they were small until I saw a friends room at a hotel on the harbour that was twice as much in cost and 30 % smaller ! ! Space is expensive in Hong Kong - get used to it ! ! The hotel is close to transport - bus 's in particular are great and the MTR station isnt that far away. Close enough to Nathan road to enjoy the sites and shopping and far enough away to avoid the noise. The supermarket across the street was a great bonus buy up on soft drinks , snacks and water as were all the laundries along Waterloo road. We could have all of our laundry done for about $ 6AUS. WHo needs to take home dirty clothes ? This alone made packing for our second visit super easy as we didnt take as much - so there was more room for purchases on the way home ! !

i managed to get a great deal kayak.com and this place was great. The subway system in HK is so amazing that the location does n't really matter--even though it 's not in the middle of the action , it 's a 10 min walk to a good area and then a 15 min ride to the heart of the action and it 's really cheap , safe , and comfortable transit the hotel also has free transfers to downtown kowloon . The hotel was very clean and the rooftop pool is a total gem .

we recently stayed at this hotel for 5days whilst visting bangkok , australia and fiji and the staff here were unbelieveably rude ! we tried to book a number of trips as to make the most out of our trip and found them over priced and the hotel tour operator rude and abrupt. we requested the tours we wished to go on and she told us they were rubbish and to go on the ones that she wanted us to and the couple in front to go on etc etc . Also she would not tell us the method of transport to the tours - dangerous ? you had to pay before she told you and it was one way so you had to first your own way back to the hotel ! ! Also if you buy an OCTOPUS card from the train station and top it up you can use it at restaurant and on public transport- loads cheaper then taxi. it makes it a safer and cheaper way to carry money as you get the deposit back when you have finished your trip ! ! ! Public transpport is safe and easy to follow in this city as its incredibly efficent ! ! ! Makes it more fun doing it on your own , to your own itinerary and choosing where to stay the longest each day ! ! The hotel is dead at night , one bar is open but the atmosphere is dull and boring !

the staff were very helpful and the complimentary breakfasts for the period we were there were an unexpected bonus .

plus points : -

many reviews lead me to believe that this hotel was a good option for our short stay in Hong Kong. We selected a standard room and it definetly needed refurbishing ! There are better options available with location and room quality .

stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Location - Well away from the main attractions eg the peak , star ferry and harbour. It is quite close to the main markets but it is still involves a good walk and in the heat of the night and day it can seem a long way .

the first disappointment is the actual location of this hotel. Its name suggests it is in the centre of Kowloon however it is not and is much further north . Do not be misled by Kowloon being in its name. I stayed in one of the lower price rooms but was very disappointed. The bathroom was very dated and was not very clena. The room itself was small and the decor was extremely dated. Despite requesting a non smoking room it was clear the room had been used by smokers as all furniture and the curtains smelt of tobacco smoke. Will not be staying here again .

the hotel is in central Kowloon , the rooms though a little small are well equipped and maintained , all areas are spotlessly clean .

this a was a nice Holiday of 8 Days where we where with Metropark i Had my Two kids 1yrs and 5yrs they too had a good fun. The hotel is setinly not in the middle of the city or near to the MTR but they surly have a Free Shuttle Bus Service to near by station MONG KOK and Tim Sa Tuisi . The Hotel is clean and the pool is also NICE THE KIDS LOVED IT

we found the hotel was exceptionally clean and tidy. The room was quite a good size with every amenity having heard that Hong Kong hotel rooms are small we were pleasantly surprised . Great LCD TV too but the usual poor channels !

when booking this hotel , I didn ` t realise how big Hong Kong actually is ! The hotel isn ` t located right in centre of Hong Kong. To get anywhere you had to walk 15 minutes to the nearest MTR station , which for us was Mong Kok. This wasn ` t a problem as we started to enjoy our daily walks seeing some interesting sights of Hong Kong along the way. The hotel does has a shuttle bus which drops you off at two locations within Kowloon and this runs every half and hour. The hotel service itself was good. The rooms were a good size and all the staff were helpful. The hotel has a roof top pool which I used when it was raining and also what looked like a mini gym. We were booked in as room only , but the hotel has its own bakery to stock up on breakfast and snacks. The travel agent located in the hotel was very helpful and we organised our day trip to China through them. Overall a good stay and I would stay there again !

the Hotel is Worth the Money Spent and the room are also big enough to Hongkong standard. The Staff is helpful. and Dont forget to use the shettle bus to Mong Kok and Tim Sa Tusi

stayed in the Metropark Kowloon , May this Year [ 2009 ] . The hotel is only a 10 min walk from ladies market , which is a must for bargain hunters. The free shuttle bus to the Promenade of Stars and the ferry area is a big bonus. Its reliable and frequent...every 30 mins or so. The food in the hotel was excellent...buffet breakfast , with everything you could wish for. The evening meals were quality food , with an excellent seafood buffet a few times a week for about Â £ 20 per head. The bar was expensive at Â £ 6 a pint for San Miguel....but at least there was a happy hour [ actually four hours ] with 2 for the price of one. The lifts were not a problem , reception was good , and the luggage room for late departures was secure . It cost us Â £ 30 to retain the room for a late departure.The room itself was on the small side , just big enough for two. Everything was clean and modern.The only problem we had was nothing to do with the hotel itself. We had problems finding a restaurant with menus written in English. Now I know that HK is now in China , but because of the British influence over the years , I expected to encounter more bars and restaurants catering to British tourists...well that was not the case in Kowloon. This proved a problem. The Chinese influence in Kowloon is now almost total. Every menu in Chinese...and not much English spoken either. If this could be a problem to you...you will be better off staying nearer to the sea front , at the bottom area of Nathan road .

we go there because it is very near to the exam center , the price is fair , because it is in a high season , and they upgrade our room into suit. Very big and clean , the bed is extremely comfortable. Good value ! !

metropark Kowloon was quite an enjoyable stay. It 's in an area that 's less hectic or noisy , yet not too far from the action. Rooms are simple , basic and practical. Free shuttle service is provided to Mongkok near MTR station and Tsim Sha Tsui from which you can walk to Star Avenue . You can opt for airport shuttle at a price we got both trips complimentary since we stayed more than 2 consecutive nights , which takes about 1 hour per way. Public buses are available at the doorstep , a supermarket across the street and plenty of food nearby .

good value hotel in Hong Kong , away from the main sights 10 mins walk from MTR station and local markets. Small rooms but clean and comfortable. When we extended our stay they gave us the rate we had originally paid with an agent rather than the walk i rate .

i booked this hotel 6 months before going partly because a friend was staying there and partly for the facilities. The pool and fitness centre was undergoing renovation so was unavailable. I would never have gone there if i 'd known this. The location was a problem too , even using the free minibus to tsim tsa tsui left a 15 minute walk to the star ferry. Going out to dinner in HK meant an hour each way minimum .

we stayed here last march 21-24.. the location was nice. friendly adn helpful staff... we bodked for a double bed but wen we got there we got a twin bed instead... though we were transfered the next day to another room with double bed... i wasnt sooo crazy about the hotel.. its so-so.. mmm average.. but i enjoeyd my stay much coz my hubby and i really needed a break.. food was nice.. i hate the ham and cheese sandwich ! ! ! ! ! but other than that the breakfast buffet was excellent. laods ot choose from and very delicious i destroyed my diet ! ... room was clean.. the bath room was ok.. the tub was small though hehhehe... but yeha,. staff are friendly and helpful.. .

stayed for a few nights with friends. Close to markets and electronics and sneaker shops about 10-15 mins walking distance . Free shuttle to and from Tsim Sha Tsui ; handy if you want to see the nighly light show by the water front. Shuttle to and from airport is available at a cost of HK $ 98 although this really should be complimentary .

i stay 3 nights at Metropark Hotel Kowloon during 31/3-3/4/09. There is no problem with my booking through agoda.com , check in &amp ; check out is easy &amp ; fast .

booked this hotel based on the number of good reviews it got from fellow travellers - it truly did not disappoint , considering the fact that HK hotels are known to scrimp on space .

stayed for three nights and arrived at abour 8.15 am expecting problems but staff were very good and had the room ready by 9.30 which was really helpful. This hotel is really in the middle of what I would call the real HK , not the glass and concete of Hong Hong Island. You will be in the midst of ordinary folk going about their normal business , and not surrounded by a million other tourists. The hotel is surrouded by what seems hundreds of little shops and cafes with English being a rarity.Our room was good , adequate standard facilities which even included a phone in the bathroom ! The view was nothing spectacular as we were on the back of the hotel and overlooked local appartments .

when we initially arrived there was some confusion regarding room allocation. 2 of our party were given smoking rooms and 1 couple were given a twin - not the best start ! However , the reception staff sorted it out for us and were very helpful. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the buffet seafood restaurant was nice. The swimming pool and gym area were closed for refurbishment so we could n't use them , but we were offered a very good deal when booking to compensate .

this is a pleasant enough hotel. My room viewed towards the back of the hotel , so it was nice and quiet ; and once I 'd worked out how to turn off the air conditioning and stop shivering , it was rather a pleasant place .

the hotel gave us a very good impression with great location 10 min walk to Mongkok MTR , Ladies Market and other busy streets in Mongkok , clean and spacious .

we stayed in this hotel a couple years ago now , but we loved it so much , I just had to comment on how fantastic this hotel is. Beautiful decor , very friendly staff and great service provided. I will be staying here again on our next trip back to HK. This hotel is located fairly close to the Temple St Night Markets and we walked around Kowloon easily from our hotel. The Sip Sip Bar is awesome. Very friendly staff here , especially a waitress called &quot ; Agather&quot ; . not sure if I spelt her name right , but either way , she 's the best ! . We had alot of help from the friendly concierge , and the lady that works at the tourist desk. In a nutshell : The best quality hotel for a great price. Loved it !

i just visited Hong Kong for 3 nights during 6-9 March 2009. I had read many good reviews about this hotel before so I decided to Stay at Metropark Kowloon. Booking through online travel agent , the price is reasonable around 580HKD per night for cheapest room without breakfast .

excellent value , spacious room , friendly staff , a great hotel for Aussie travellers of all ages. staff even prepared a breakfast box on checkout as we had an early flight to london.breakfasts are lovely , catering for all tastes .

  of us travelling - first time in HK. Stayed one week. No problems arranging for adjoining/smoking rooms on arrival. Reception staff efficient , friendly and helpful. Rooms spacious and very clean , we wanted for nothing and we were not in 'top of the range ' rooms. Swimming pool unavailable/under renovation - Hotel advised us prior to our visit and we could have changed to another hotel but did n't feel we would be desperate for swimming in HK during February. Had breakfast most mornings - tremendous range of food , beautifully presented , no tummy upsets and staff superb ! Free Shuttle Bus was brilliant. We really could not fault this hotel and staying here really made for a wonderful Hong Kong holiday .

stayed at the Metropark for four nights , thought is was a very good hotel .

i recently stayed at the Metropark Kowloon. This was my second stay. The hotel is located in a more residential area of East Mong Kok , but is convenient to Nathan Road , the Ladies Market , and a variety of public transportation that includes numerous buses with service to Tsim Sha Tsui , Hong Kong Island and beyond , the Star Ferry Terminal both Tsim Sha Tsui and Hung Hom , and the Hung Hom Railway Station on the East Rail Line , two MTR Stations Yau Ma Tei and and Mong Kok , and the East Rail Line East Mong Kok Station * . Schedules and locations of bus routes are posted in English and Chinese at each of the bus stops. The East Rail Line goes to the mainland border. In the direction of Tsim Sha Tsui the train stops at the Hung Hom Railway Station where you can take direct trains to Guangzhou , Shanghai , and Beijing .

the hotel appearance is very modern and clean , very much like a 5-star hotel. The rooms are great , mid-size with very clean and modern bathrooms which are a great plus . Most hotels have rooms that are clean and modern and the bathrooms are usually a bit old. But metropark was fabulous. It was truly a very comfortable stay. The location was good for us as it was about a 5minute walk to all the night markets and very good eateries were around the area. It 's a bit of a hustle and bustle outside but we prefered this much more so than in the CBD area. We paid 2-3star rates for a 5star hotel ! Swimming pool is currently out of service due to renovations. A +

we are a group of eight 6 adults and 2 kids and i personally picked the place because it 's not a too crowded area for the kids. i booked through agoda and i have no problems with regards to my booking. they have a shuttle bus that runs every 30 mins to Mongkok MTR station and TST. there are many restaurants within the area. Ladies market is just walking distance from the hotel. or you can catch the shuttle bus in going to MOngkok and afterwards walk your way to the hotel 10-15 mins . hotel staff are very accomodating especially when it comes to directions to attractions in hongkong .

this was an excellent hotel for the money. Very nice room and good service. The breakfast buffet is very good , with plenty of asian and western choices. And for some reason , every morning they would give me a coupon for my breakfast. Do n't know if you can expect this or not ! :

great hotel. great staff. everything very easy to fix and solve. no major dramas. I personally liked the breakfeast. a mix of continental and chinese , but i suspect other hotels could be as good. overall i would book another night wihout any problems

we were initially given a twin room , which was a bit of an annoyance. no apologies-which seemed to be the attitude of the staff in general. that twin room was nice , quite spacious for a hongkong hotel really. interesting thing was it contained a bath and a universal adapter power board with 3 empty slots , lan cable for free internet usage .

was very impressed by this hotel. It was only a short walk from the centre and main street , but far enough away that it made for pleasant stay. Did not eat in the hotel , but that was only because there were so many eateries to choose from. Great wee supermarket across the road for any basics you want and launderette and chemist also. Did not really know what to expect as have never been to China before but would definately go back again , and stay here. Only complaint was they web-site said the pool would be closed for maintenance and it was n't , but it did look nice when we went up for a look .

i stayed at the Metropark on 26th and 27th December. The hotel is in a good location about a 5-10 minute walk to the MTR station and there are plenty of markets within walking distance. I booked a non smoking room but was given a smoking room. They did not have a non smoking room until the 2nd night. The difference in the room was incredible. Not only the smell ! ! Much nicer decoration and ambiance. That was the only reason I give this review a 3 and not a 4. Bear in mind to be sure you have a non smoking room if your not a smoker of course !

we spent 4 days and 3 nights in HongKong at Metropark , Kowloon hotel .

stayed at this hotel for 6 days. Upon check in i was upgraded to a executive room which was superb. you could not fault the room , fully equipped,excellent bathroom , very clean with good housekeeping. Breakfast was also very good and the staff helpful. Reception have some good maps of the city and provide a free return courtesy bus to mongkok and the city centre every 30 mins. the hotel is about 10-15 mins walk to the nearest tube station and 15 mins walk to mongkok and Nathan road. The best way to the hotel from the airport is get a coach which can be booked from the arrivals hall at HK airport and they charge 130 HK dollars and take u to the hotel which can take between 30-60 mins. Do not take the light railway as it does not take u to mongkok unless u want to change 3 times and its not any cheaper. 15 mins walk takes you to nathan road which is miles and miles of shops and eating places .

we just returned from our family holiday staying in Metropark Kowloon from 27-12-2008 to 02-01-2009. Our stay was great and got the best hospitality by the hotel which we booked after reading the various reviews about the Hotels in HK through Tripadvisor. Our got quick checkin at 1 AM. Mr. Kimmy Kwok the reservation mananger &amp ; Ms. Cathy Tin helped me providing 1 day more stay , than our booking as my daughter got ill in our trip , even they inquire by visiting us .

excellent hotel. Our reservation was upgraded when we told them we were on our honeymoon so result !

a lot of good reviews about the hotel here. And I agree with most. It is clean , good service and reasonably sized for Asia. The location is pretty good. The fact that it is a 10 min walk to the MTR is mitigated by the free shuttle to New World Centre at Tsim Sha Tsui. From there you can walk to the ferry for HK , or just check out TST. Also note the 113 bus stops on the same block as the hotel , and takes you to Hong Kong. It is cheaper than the MTR but might take longer during rush hour. Also when you are walking along the HK side , check out the bus stops for 113 , because it takes you right to the hotel. Sometimes it takes a lot of walking to get to the MTR. Some of this info is provided by the back of the hotel 's shuttle schedule. Read it .

i booked this hotel based on price and location. At the front desk I was attended by Alex , he is good and attended to all of my requests. I was surprised that he upgraded me to the Club floor which I later found out only when I got out of the elevator. Club floor cost more but I didnt pay any more than what I booked for. Thanks Alex !

we recently did a round the world trip with the 1st stop being 3 nights in HK. I 'd looked at loads of hotel reviews and as we were looking for a reasonable price our trip was 10 weeks long so we had to budget ! I thought we 'd be in a very basic hotel. We found a deal through Travelmood which offered a &quot ; hot deal&quot ; - airport transfers , 3 nights in the hotel and a half day tour of HK. I 'd read that the club rooms had free snacks so asked to upgrade. The total cost in September was Â £ 270 for both of us , inc the upgrade. This gave us a beautiful room with free internet access , the free &quot ; snacks&quot ; from 5 - 7 each evening - which actually consisted of a full buffet and drinks - and breakfast. It was excellent value. The staff were extremely helpful , the courtesy bus was great , the pool was an added bonus , on the roof. Location was great. Although we did n't need it there is also a shuttle bus to the airport which was reasonably priced ca n't remember exactly how much .We did n't eat out in the evening at all as the buffet was so filling , so we hardly spent a penny over and above our initial outlay , apart from shopping .

we recently staayed at the metropark and found it to be excellent in all areas,Staff very helpful very user friendly rooms immaculate and food in the restaurantts of a very high order .

i traveled with my family comprising my wife and 2 children for 5 days and 4 nights in Hong Kong. I decided to book this hotel after doing some researches on the internet. I booked through the hotel website which gave a good package for staying 3 nights and above .

this was our 2nd stay at the Metropark Kowloon Hotel in 12months. Mong Kok is a great area to stay in and the hotel is within 10 minutes of the markets and Nathan Road. Shuttle bus takes you to the mtr and tst. We have been to Hong Kong 14 times in the last 20 years and have always stayed at different hotels. The Metropark is the first that we have stayed at more than once. Already planning our next trip and we will come back to the Metropark. The staff were lovely and checkin and checkout only took 5minutes both times .

booked Metropark Kowloon through expedia and got a club room at 50 % off. The room was really nice. Quite spacious for Hongkong. The only negative was the bed. It was rock hard ! ! We didnt ask about changing rooms as thought all the beds would be the same , however when speaking to some other guests they said the bed they had was very comfortable ?

going by Trip Advisor , rather than our Hong Kong born travel agent , we selected the Metropark. We were not disappointed ! It was just far enough from the hustle &amp ; bustle to give us a break from Hong Kong 's 24/7 pace. With the complimentary hotel shuttle bus to Tsimshatsui and Mongkok we had convenient access to all of Kowloon. Both the Kowloon-Canton Railway and the MTR Underground stations were a five minute walk from the Metropark. The MTR wisks you to Hong Kong Island in a matter of minutes. Check-in was fast &amp ; friendly. The elevators always worked. Our room was comfortable with a full range of amenities. The buffet breakfast had both western and Chinese choices. We did n't use the pool as there were thunder storms and heavy rain almost the whole week we were in Hong Kong. The hotel was very convenient for accessing our tours to Hong Kong Island and Macau. Shopping was just a few minutes away in Mongkok or by the MTR underground to other areas. We usually had dinner at a Mongkok restaurant. Across the street from the hotel is the large Hoover Restaurant. It serves dim sum until 4pm. We usually tried to get back there for a late lunch. Our travel agent thought we should be right in the centre of activities around Tsimshatsui. On reflection , we were very happy to be a little bit out of the way in the very comfortable Metropark on Waterloo Street. When we next go to Hong Kong , we will look forward to staying at the Metropark again .

used this hotel as my base for a 10 day stay. Very clean and comfortable. All staff encountered were polite and efficient .

stayed here whilst on a business trip to Hong Kong and China. During october 2008. Stayed here years ago and it was all a bit run down. Now it really does represent good value for money with many rooms now being refurbished. The rooms are n't large but the n again none are in HK. I actually checked out whilst I visited China and the conciege were good enough to look after my large suitcase until I checked back in 6 days later .

this Hotel was ideal for a break in Hong Kong .

hotel was OK , nothing special .

this hotel is perfect if you are having a stop over. Its location is good and the hotel has a couple of nice restaurants. They have a good menu to suit all tastes. The rooms were standard and what you would expect but it was clean and had coffee/tea facility which was perfect for our overnight stay. We arrived at 8 : 30am and did n't expect them to let us have the room until lunchtime but they gave us immediate access which was appreciated after a long flight. The staff were all efficient and you could not fault their service .

excellent hotel , not the best location but 5 mins walk to Mong Kok train station. Cant complain about anything about it .

stayed for 3 nights out and return from Oz. For the money Â £ 43 pn it was pretty good. Recently refurbished room , smallish maybe v small for Americans but adequate room well equipped and helpful staff , especially the concierge. The buffet breakfast was ample and the main restaurant not bad. As for location , it is obviously not as convenient as those down by the ferry , but was in a residential district which gave a one an idea of real HK. The shuttle bus is Ok but sometimes full and drops you off 5-10 mins walk from the ferry. Better take the No 7 bus from the stop bang opposite the hotel for about 35 pence which goes right to the ferry. With taxis so cheap and plentiful , it is not a problem being a little way from the Metro/markets/airport bus etc .

i stayed for three nights here - I splurged and got a club floor room , which would have been just slightly more than a regular room in TST or Central .

it 's very small , even by HK standards. You can do better. The view is depressing .

good hotel in Kowloon , if you end up on the executive floor , your room and amenities will be much better than the other standard rooms. Executive has comfy newly renovated decor. We stayed one night in a standard and the room was decorated in the 1980s and has n't been touched since. It is a bit of a walk from the train station , 15 mins. Nice and close to the &quot ; pet market&quot ; and the sporting goods market&quot ;

i Finished an extensive adventure through Mainland China as a single Mom traveller with my 7 year old daughter by staying at this hotel and flying back to Canada from Hong Kong !

the place was betten than my expectations... the check in and the check out was really fast... the rooms are clean and big compare to other hotels. We stayed in the renew floor and it was very comfortable , there is not in safe in the renew floor but they offered us a safety box downstair. The only bad thing is that it is a bit far away from MTR station , about 15 minutes walk , but you can always take the taxi , which is cheap and safety. I would definetely recommend it .

  adults and a teenger stayed Aug 08. Booked a triple room which had 3 single beds which was ok for 3 days Any longer and it would have been a bit cramped . We were on 19th floor which was great for the pool and had a view out onto the main street. The main road was quite noisy but it did not affect my sleep. The pool was fairly small but big enough to have a decent swim in and there was a small gym with running machines and a nintendo wii that were free to use. You can not smoke by the pool which meant you had to get dressed and go back to your room if you wanted a cigarette Towels were provided for you. There were plenty of sunloungers and they were never all occupied while we were there. There was piped music everywhere , in the lifts , corridors and by the pool but it was easy to tune it out. Breakfast was good with plenty of choices an as it was buffet style you could eat as much as you wanted. The hotel was a good central base , plenty of taxis and airport express bus to train station stopped outside. Not far from Ladies Market or Mogkok East MTR station. Small resturant next door Tereas served fab food at cheap prices but closes at 10pm so we only got there on our last night. Plenty to see and do in HK and travel is so cheap and easy. Would stay there again

we returned yesterday from 2 weeks stay at the Metropark Kowloon .

free transfer from the airport. it was their promo that time Very clean room. Free shuttle to Mongkok MTR. What more can you ask for ?

we booked our stopover stay to between UK and New Zealand 2 nights both ways. I booked direct with the hotel which was very straightforward with quick responses when organising airport transport and additional kids bed .

location

was booked in here by a travel agent after previous stays in the Causeway Bay branch had been fine. The stay was terrible - internet access was dodgy , I was put in a smoking room despite being a non-smoker , the food was average stay way from the omelettes and the room shabby. It was a 15 minute walk from the MTR which is not fun in summer and local restaurants were non-existent .

this was booked by our client for a 3-week business stay in Kowloon. The location was nice for us , being more a a neighborhood area but still walkable to Mongkok Station. There was also free internet in the rooms , which was very nice. The rooftop pool was nice as well , although fairly full of noisy overweight foreign tourists .

the hotel was clean and nice. It was far from the MTR but just catch a taxi for a few dollars back. This is important after running around all day. The staff in the restraunt was very nice the breakfast was a good way to start the day. If you stay in this hotel only book the club floor they are much nicer as I had to stay in the other room for one night because they overbooked. Everyone in the hotel was polite except the front desk staff but if you do need something ask for Joan she was great. Overall this was a good stay .

we stayed 3 nights .

although we booked through a travel agent , when we arrived we were give the opportunity to upgrade to the Exec floor for Â £ 80 for the week .

excellent hotel ,

i booked the hotel room in January but when I came to stay in July 2008 they were renovating levels 3-7. So they gave me an upgraded room on level 15. It was a nicer room .

the Metropark hotel Kowloon is a great hotel for the money. the rooms are large with a full bathroom , dressing table , TV and fridge. there are 2 supermarkets near the hotel one is directly across the road and the other is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel towards Mong Kok MTR station. these sell a wide range of foods including western. we bought fruit and cereal for the 4 days for the cost of 1 breakfast in the hotel .

we have just returned from Hong Kong &amp ; after lots of reading on this sight we settled on this hotel. We booked it through our travel agent , but then we e-mailed the hotel direct to get an upgrade to the club floor .

a large hotel in run down part of city. We found like other reviewers that the room was cold with very firm beds , desk staff unfriendly , restaurant overpriced with poor service , and outlook shabby. On plus side : rates were better than many , the pool was great , shuttle bus was very useful , and overall efficiency was good .

metropark kowloon is a clean business hotel with friendly staff. We booked a club room on the 16th floor. The package included breakfast and an afternoon drink in the clublounge. We can recommend this for all future travelers. The outside noice is zero and we had quite a nice view. But who cares the view , Hong Kong is a city waiting to be explored .

i booked and stayed in an executive room after reading the various reviews posted by previous traveller...and quite frankly i was quite satisfied with the room allocated... on the 17th floor ...room was quite large - though the storage was quite limited-

  had free buffet breakfast during our stay - excellent food and variety ! : D

my friend and I stayed here for 9 nights after booking through a student based travel agency. for the price we paid , we really wer n't sure wat to expect , and the mixed reviews on the site didnt help either .

just back from Metropark Kowloon. We had a room on the club floors which meant we had a few extras included in the price .

location : a bit of distance to the nearest MTR station , around 10-15 minutes walk , in summer it would be too much for me .

stayed there for two separate 4 night periods. Had booked my stay via their own company email months ago. We had no problems with first stay period , however on return from trip to Bangkok , found our triple occupancy room had been given away to others by duty manager &quot ; Eric&quot ; , who himself needs a refresher course in customer service. Felt his atitude was very poor. His overiding aim was to do his job fast but with no consideration for customers. Finally allocated a room with 2 beds and had to wait 20 minutes for a rollaway bed. This arrived but the mattress was so uncomfortable that it needed to be changed. The next rollaway had a blood stained mattress protector which if we had n't complained , they would have laid sheets on and tried to pass its stain away. Management tried to pass over this problem by giving us free breakfast , however this was not worth the money. By enlarge the worst food I 've seen for a long time .

we had none of the problems experienced elsewhere. The staff were fine - nothing was a problem. On one part of our journey we arrived early in the morning. At other hotels we may well have been told to push off until the afternoon but here the room was ready after just an hour. The free shuttle bus to the harbour area was very good and regular. The pool on the roof is well worth a visit. The hotel is on a busy main road Waterloo Road in mid-Kowloon but we found this to be an advantage , because we found some excellent eateries nearby that obviously are n't visited by many tourists. Really friendly people , though. And infinitely cheaper than eating at the hotel. The hotel bar was OK , but expensive , and a bit desperate , with fashion TV playing endlessly , and full of bored-looking tourists .

what a great find ! Hong Kong hotels are expensive and have small rooms so when we arrived at The Metropark Kowloon and checked into our Club Room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was large by Hong Kong standards with a double bed , 2 bedside tables , desk , fridge , large flat screen TV armchair and there was still enough room for 2 big suitcases to lie opne on the floor. The room was n't giant but plenty big enough , and I guess you could say that it was massive by Hong Kong standards. The bathroom was large but with no bath , however , the shower cubicle was more than double size and if you prefer showers as we do then it could be condisered a bonus .

we arrived at the Hotel after a long journey Cape Town , Jhb and then Hong Kong so we were pretty exhausted when we checked in. Upon checking in we were told that our room was not ready but that it would be ready within an hour. We accepted that and decided to walk around for that hr to pass the time. We came back to be told that the room was still not ready. We then told them that they said it would be ready , and to this they said that they had found a room to give to us. Our luggage was taken to the room to be found that two very single beds was given to us. I asked the staff member that why had we been given two single beds when we had booked a double. He said that this was one of the better rooms. I then took this up with Erik Mak the Manager on duty at the time to be told that it had not been booked as a double. I didnt want to argue at the time as I didnt have the paperwork in front of me. I then went to the room and found all the correspondence that proved that a double had been booked. He then said that the hotel was fully booked. I told him that this hotel had been booked long in advance and we should have been told that this was not available. He also told me that the communication that he received via the international agents did not say anything about a double room. I asked him to show me this email to which he did. It definately did not state a double room but the confirmation from Thompsons Travel definately stated a double room. I then said that he should have checked upon us checking in , whether we wanted single beds seeing that we were a couple. We only go away once a year and this to us is like another honeymoon. Under no circumstances could two people sleep in that single beds. They were genuinely single beds and nothing more. I received a letter of apology from the hotel once getting back to SA but that did not alter the fact that our holiday was spoiled by this arrangement .

we are frequent travelers to Hong Kong and have been there at least 12 times before. This time we were in Hong Kong for three nights on a stopover .

we stayed at the Metropark for 2 days at the beginning of April and 2 Days at the end .

we stayed at the Metropark Hotel for 4 nights on the way to Bali and found this to be a great city hotel in a good location. We were upgraded for some reason to the club floor and our room was small but modern. We only used the room to sleep and it had everything we needed. It was clean with a choice of pillows and had a lovely powerful shower , although in probably the smallest bathroom I 've ever seen .

its difficult..Especially for people who are looking for a hotel in hong kong. After all the mixed views of the metropark it confuses people , as it did for me before i went. was very skeptical before arriving at the metropark becuase of the different opinions and the terrible images of the hotel on many websites that just give a totally false impression of this hotel and make it look like faulty towers .

my daughter and I holidayed in Hong Kong last february 2007 , we had the most fantastic time . This hotel is located a bit of walk from Nathan Road probably 10mins or so but theres a lot of little local shops that you can look at on the way to the main shops. You never know you might just pick up a bargain. My daughter has a shoe fettish so everytime we went shopping she bought heaps of shoes and the staff at the hotel would even line them up neatly for her in the morning. Mong Kok is close by with tonnes of malls with hundreds of bargains especially for women. Reception staff were very curteous and helpful with directions etc Perfect hotel if you dont want to be near the noise but still close to the action !

i am very satisfied with this hotel. The people were professional and courteous , even the bell boys spokesome English. It 's easily reached by no. 7 bus , which stops right in front of the hotel from Tsim Sha Tsui , Star Ferry . Yau Ma Tei metro is 15 mins away by walking. Hotel shuttle bus takes you to Mong Kok metro stop , which takes you all the way across the harbor to Central. Its near the Ladies Market , Jade Market and the Night Market. I received free South China Morning Post every morning. The room has a small frig ; although it has some drinks which you have to pay for if you used them it has some room for drinks that you purchased yourself. The hotel is near many eateries..bakeries , noodle shops , 711 , McDonald is five mins away on the right. No need to buy their buffet breakfast. My room was on the eight floor. It was clean , spacious and quiet. The bed and the pillows were comfortable. The only thingt that bordered me was the room was cold , and you were supposed to keep the AC on at all times which I turn off , anyway . If you take the hotel shuffle bus from the airport , be sure to email the hotel first and ask for the price of the trip and take a copy with you....the guy at the airport hotel bus shuffle counter wants HKD 130 one way per passenger . Luckily , I had the hotel email that says it 's HKD 95 ! After I showed the email , he gave my daughter and I HKD 180 for two persons ! A great hotel...I would stay here again .

we stayed here between 28th March and 4th Apri , for the price I paid I was very impressed with the room. We had a normal comfort room and it was a reasonable size although the bed was a bit short and my 6ft boyfriend had his feet sticking out the end of the end . The shower was one of the best we 've had in a hotel. The room was clean and conceirge was very helpful. I reccomend getting the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. Wa sno hassle you just go to the stand at the airport and it only cost $ 95hk each. Which for the ease of it was great value. We used the free shuttle bus at least once a day and we always got on. All in all very impressed and would definatly stay there again .

stayed here for 3 nights in January 2008 , and got upgraded to one of the 'Club ' floor rooms. Room was clean , modernly decorated and well furnished. Service in the hotel was good. Hotel seemed to provide a range of good facilities. All very comfortable .

ok so last year I said to myself that I have seen all that I need to see in Hong Kong , so thats why I went there again this year. My 1st choice of hotel had to be for the forth time , the Metropark in Kowloon .

we stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon in Asia. The hotel was booked through our travel agent and it was the only 3 star hotel we booked for our holiday - all others were 4 or 5 star so I supose my inital reaction was dissapointment but I only had myself to blame and this was in comparison to the other hotels we stayed at which would be unfair to compare .

a good functional hotel , with decent enough rooms and facilities .

large hotel with 2 restaurants , rooftop pool and a fitness room. Room was a good size , clean and comfortable. You can change your pillow 4 types to choose from definitely helped improve my sleep. Bed was a little on the hard side. Room was cold - staff sent up a heater promptly when asked and we had to have the heater on all the time to keep the room tempaerature on the warmer side. Complimentary tea/coffe and water which was replinished everyday .

my fiance and I stayed at this hotel from 2/15 - 2/18 and again on 2/19 - 2/21. This was our first trip to Hong Kong .

i stayed here for a week while on a business trip. Main reason for booking this hotel was its close proximity to my office. But , I was really impressed with just about everything here....the price , level of service , room comfort , etc. If available , spend a bit extra for a Club Level room--extra amenities and very quiet floors. The only reason I would not stay here again is just to experience other hotels in Hong Kong---this is simply a GREAT hotel !

stayed here for a week , was nice place . very comfy and nice rooms. Its location compared to other hotels in Hong Kong is a bit far away its 10 min walk to Nathan Road

my husband and I , with our 2 kids , aged 3 years , and 8 months , stayed for 10 days over Christmas 2007. We stayed on the Kowoon side to be closer to my husband 's family , but I really enjoyed staying away from the tourist traps and being able to get a feel for how people live here .

stayed at Metropark Kowloon for just over 2 weeks. Was there with a group of friends and we occupied 4 rooms .

unexpected luxuriously hotel .

excellent hotel,could n't ask for anymore..efficent service,rooms clean and decent size .

booked with HRS.com and when I arrived they could not find my reservation. I showed them my printed confirmation and after 20 minutes of looking through the computer and going to the back office , they said they still said they could do nothing for me. I raised my voice a bit in front of some other guests and finally they gave me the room that I reserved .

i booked the hotel via the hotel 's reservations web-page for a double room from Jan 26-30 , 2008 .

i stayed at metropark during christmas 2007 and booked it early to get a good price. one thing i did before I booked was check thoroughly and researched as much as i can about this hotel and i came across tripadvisor. I got my answer here and people gave it good reviews .

exceeds our expectation of a 3 star hotel. We got a complimentary room upgraded to Spacious type. Loved the chicken pie at the hotel bakery. Convenient for eateries and supermarket Wellcome &amp ; Manning opposite the hotel. There is a very nice restaurant only few doors away at left side of hotel serving delicious roasted goose and pork , and they are open from 7am till 12am .

stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for 2 nights between xmas and New Year. The room was very clean , though due to our late arrival all the double rooms had been taken and we had to have a twin instead. After hearing reports that HK hotel rooms are small , was surprised to find the room was about the same size as a typical hotel in the UK. It is a good 10 minute walk to the nearest MTR stations Yau Ma Tei or Mongkok . The hotel shuttle will drop you near the Mongkok MTR or near the Avenue of the Stars in Tsim Sha Shui. The pool is small but was never busy. The fitness room is also small , but it does contain a Nintendo Wii ! Hotel bakery was excellent and very cheap. Buffet breakfast was also great. Staff were more than happy to store our bags for the day due to late departing flight .

this hotel was very comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Its location is good , as easy walking distance to Mongkok MTR and also Nathan Road. We didnt use the pool , so cant comment on that. We stayed in Kowloon as the hotels are much cheaper than Hong Kong Island , and away from the hustle and bustle , but within walking distance. The hotel has a free shuttle bus that take s you to Star Ferry terminal , and they run all day until 10pm , so we used this quite a lot .

was a good hotel and well priced when compared to some others. Is not as close to Lady 's Market or the MTR station as we thought , but not excessively far. has been renovated so everything is relatively nice and new. Will be staying here again .

we ended up staying at this hotel due to the fact we booked our flights to nz via hk and wanted to stay at metropark causewaybay only to find out a few weeks later that it was full,and so was everywhere else in dec as its conference season.as afamily of 2 adults and 2 children aged 5&amp ; 3 we had to have 2 connecting rooms which was expensive.only reason i mention this is the hotel will not allow 4 in a room however on our way back the hotel again was fulland we could not have connect room so they put single bed in room for my kids. hotel is about 30 mins from airport in a red taxi cost about 20pounds.hotel is ok have stayed at worse. pay a little extra for club i thought it was worth it.only real gripe was the air con which was freezing.can turn it off in room at switch but it makes no diff as i got houskeeping in the end to assist but the main hotel aircon still comes into the room.staff are helpful and friendly and the little bus to the market and harbour is useful.taxis are cheap .

located along Waterloo Road , Mongkok , this hotel is a little off the beaten track but still only a short 10-15 minute walk to the nearest MTR Mongkok station. Also the KCR Railway Station is close by so is ideal for anyone planning trip to New Territories or Shenzhen , China .

the hotel is located at Mongkok which is near to Ladies Market , Goldfish market , Flower market , Temple Street , etc. It 's in the centre of shopping area and many good local food .

i chose the hotel by price. It was in a reasonable area of uptown Kowloon with Prince Edward MRT station a few minutes walk away as well as numerous bus services. Check-in always seemed to be busy but the staff were friendly. I had asked for a room as high as possible and got the sixth floor of thirteen . The room seemed to have everything you expected , with courtesy soap , shampoo , foam bath , toothbrush and toothpaste. It had the inevitable over priced minibar fridge but there was a 7-11 convenience store across the road .

stayed at the Metropark as asingle traveller for 2 weeks. located outside the main tourist area but with all main attrations within easy reach by bus,minibus,taxi mtr train or kcr train.T IP buy an octopus card at any mtr station,this gives you cheap travel on most public transport and saves using small change !

this Hotel was great .

first time in HK , a little worried about location vis a vis public transport. Naturally , the last day in town we discovered that the closer Mongkok East station linked to the MTR at Tsim Sha Tsui East-- much shorter walk. The free K6 bus in front of the hotel makes runs to the Kowloon station for the Airport Express every 25 minutes .

we spent 12 nights at the Metropark Kowloon with our 3 teenagers and found the accomodation quite adequate. Considering how little we paid approx $ 55Aus per room per night we certainly cant complain. The rooms are a little tired but still great value. We emailed the Hotel the day before we were due to arrive to confirm our booking and request for adjoining rooms with a roller away and everything was in order when we arrived. Didnt use the shuttle bus much but used the no 7 bus across the road as it took us directly to the Star Ferry .

stayed for 7 nights from November 23-30 , 2007. Hotel shuttle bus/van runs every 30 minutes to Fa Yuen Street in Mong Kok Shoes and electronics shops and New World Centre which is walking distance to Harbour view at Tsim Sha Tsui. Walking to nearest MTR Mong Kok is not so bed either , only about 10 minutes walk. The AC is quite cold , but I guess I 'd like it better during summer months in HK. Room is basically clean with daily service with clean towels. Rooftop swimming pool and gym with a few workout machines .

flew from wales to hong kong direct and stayed in this hotel for one week , clean rooms , good friendly staff , the bar stays open until 12 and has a big screen tv that some how only plays fashion tv. but there is a great bar just around the corner from the hotel and that has live music and open until 4am .

we were concerned about finding a hotel in Hong Kong : would it meet western standards , is it accessible , how 's the service personnel , etc ? ? ? We were so pleasantly surprised .

pluses :

stayed at the Metropark for 5 nights. Efficient check in and got twin non smoking room as requested. The only down side that the Air Con in the room could not be switched off and myself and friend found we were too cold. Housekeeping brought us blankets and a heater which we had to use on getting up in a morning. Someone else may be glad of a cold room and probably in the hot humid season we would have been too. Otherwise the room was clean , of average size with decent bathroom and maid service daily. There was a light that showed outside the door to either request making up the room or do not disturb which was handy as with door hangers they either fall or somone removes it. Staff overall were friendly. Location of hotel was fine. Some of the earlier reviews commented that it was too far out but they obviously do n't like walking ! We did n't use the hotels free shuttle as it was only a 10 min walk to an MTR station. Walking is the best way to see a city and we got to know several different ways back to the hotel. To get to this hotel from the airport get the airport express to Kowloon station and then go to the free transfer bus that runs every 24 mins .

i stayed 2 nights at the Metropark Hotel on Waterloo Rd from October 15. i booked an executive suite as the hotels website says that they were being renovated .

just returned from 10 days at this great hotel. booked their executive package directly with the hotel which included free breakfasts , free drinks in the executive lounge each day for two hours ! ! plus many other extras - well worth the money. Buses opposite the hotel take you directly to the Star Ferry or you have a 10 minute walk to the metro station or the ladies market for shopping ! Very friendly staff and hotel room was great. will definitely be going back again in another 2 years

we stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for 6 nights in July â   07 as part of our trip-around-the-world , and chose this hotel as our base to explore Hong Kong .

the hotel is a bit old but OK. As mentioned in other posts , it is a bit far from things. You can take Bus # 7 to the star ferry terminal ; ask the concierge. There are not many restaurants nearby but we counted three bakeries , which we took full advantage of .

at first I was not happy with this hotel because it seemed to be far from everything , but to Nathan Road is approx. 15 min. walk , and 10 min to Ladys Market , the hotel has own shuttle to Ladys Market and Star Ferry , so it was ok. So you will be not forced to walk if you do n't like it ; Room was big , bigger than in other hotels in HK ; Swimming pool and fitness room were on the roof - nice view ! Breakfast was copious , you have european and asian dishes - joghurts , fruits , cheese ! ! ! , rise , noodles , sausages , bred etc etc etc - everything you need ;

stayed twice at this hotel. First time the room was more recently renovated. Twin beds. Mattress quite hard. Flatscreen TV on wall emitted a bright blue light on its control panel which made it hard to sleep at night as the whole room seemed illuminated. Couldnt switch it off .

good place to stay if you need a central location. Room comfortable. Good free shuttle bus that takes you to the two major shopping places. We stayed here to break up our journey to Sydney. Staff friendly. Nice bar attached to the hotel .

travelled to HK with my husband then fiance I am FROM Hong Kong and stayed there for 5 days. Not recommended at all. The hotel is &quot ; far&quot ; from MTR subway and all sites. FAR = &gt ; have to walk for more than 15 minutes is considered Far in Hong Kong There is no bus , nor minivan that goes to the MTR station either. Hotel does provide shuttle but we never took it -since they run at a certain schedule. Hotel room itself is more like a &quot ; motel&quot ; . Paid around 550HKD for 1 night. There are alot more far better and more convienent choices in HK. Will NOT go back though they have now changed to &quot ; Metropark&quot ; - even if they upgrade all the rooms to 5star quality , the location is NOT going to change .

this hotel is reasonably priced. Excellent service from EVERYONE on the staff. Both front desk and concierge are very helpful. I found the free WIFI in the lobby and high speed internet in the room very convenient since I brought my own laptop. I was able to charge all my gadgets everyday , thanks to the international power outlets. There are quite a few restaurants around the block. The one on Victory Road has good Hainanese chicken. The room is spacious by HK standard , clean but beaten down. Did not look as good as what 's in the photos and definitely needs some renovation. The location is more residential than tourist. Quite far away from subway station , at least 15 minutes of power walk. The free hotel shuttle to Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui compensated some. I 'll stay there again .

we stayed in the Metropark for 3 nights in May booked through our travel agent. OUr first problem was on arrival- we had flown in from New Zealandso were very jetlagged and arrived to be told we would have to wait for our room and not only that that the double plus cot we had booked was now going to be 2 singles ! When we came back later to get the keys the receptionist said he had managed to get us a double room but we would have to do without a cot as they were all booked out- he did n't seem to care that we had pre-booked just looked at me blankly. Despite going back the next morning we were told there were still no cots available so for the 3 nights our 22 month old had to sleep in with us- had she been any younger this simply would have been unsafe. There were a few other young children staying in the hotel but this is something they need to plan for , especially as I imagine most people staying there had pre-booked. Otherwise the hotel was ok , food was a bit bland but ok for feeding kids but shuttle bus into Kowloon was good/ service was ok , but do n't expect any help if you are struggling with a pushchair/ luggage etc !

metro park hotel was excellent , we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel , it was clean ,the staff were polite. We had an executive room on the 17th floor which entitled us to a quick check in and check out,breakfast , plus the happy hour , believe me pay the extra , it 's well worth it The view from our room was not so good , but I did n't go to stand and look out of the hotel window .We took the free shuttle bus down to the ferry terminal and a ferry across to Hong Kong Island,then onto the bus for a ride up the Peak. This was a ride with a difference and a view to match. There are a good few restaurants and shops , we had lunch at the Peak cafe looking out over the bay. The train ride back down is not to be missed.Also the one thing you just have to do is afternoon tea at the Penninsula hotel , Expensive , yes , worth it , of couse. There are lots of different markets and a night market not far from the hotel.We would recommend the Metro Park Hotel on the basis of excellent value,good service and cleanliness

this hotel was not our first choice but our preferred hotel was fully booked. So my partner and I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights , from August 14 to 22. If not for their business development manager , Anita , we wouldn â   t have been able to stay 8 consecutive nights â   and at a really great rate too ! We only confirmed our Hong Kong trip a day or 2 before checking in â   during the busy HK Food Expo. We were one of the exhibitors. Last minute decision .

we have just returned from a week stay in HOng Kong. We stayed in Metropark Kowloon , a great hotel with easy excess to Hong Kong major shopping centres. The hotel also provided shuttle bus to the major shopping areas in Kowloon. Metropark Kowloon is located slightly off the busy area in Mong kok but you can easily walk back to the hotel. It takes about 10 mins to walk from the MRT station back to the hotel. We did n't have much trouble as the map provided by the hotel is easy to follow .

decently priced hotel , but the rooms are old and not well kept. You feel that you are in a hotel which has not been serviced for some time. Although a little far from Metro , they provide a shuttle every half hour. Overall I would suggest is that if you dont have any other hotel near the harbour , you can stay here. The benefit of staying in the hotel is that it has easy access to the nearby markets .

this hotel was very inexpensive and to be honest I did not expect it to be anything great when I booked it through my travel agent.It was everything you could ask for and more.It was central to everything and the room was absolutely perfect and spotless.All the staff were very friendly and they could not do enough for you.Very friendly-very kind-always with a lovely smile and nothing was ever a bother.They all made my stay in Hong Kong a very memorable time and if hopefully in the future I return to this lovely country I will DEFINATELY be staying at the Metropark in Kowloon.I have rated this hotel as EXCELLENT and it is truely well deserved.Thankyou very very much all at the Metropark .Mrs E Riley &amp ; my 9 year old nephew Sam .

looked up Hongkong hotels on a website for last minute bookings and the Metropark was listed. Looked up reviews and description in Tripadvisor. It had good reviews so booked with the cheapest link that gives you a price and the price was just what I was looking for .

everything you need from a hotel and more

on arrival at the airport we waited for the hotel link bus which was great , my only gripe was that we were the last drop off so after numerous hotel drops and over 1hr 20m later we arrived after a 12 hour flight it was even more exhausting .

cant recommend it enough. The rooms were excellent the staff couldnt do enough for you really clean and friendly service .

we stayed three nights at Metropark Hotel Kowloon on Waterloo Road in Hong Kong in May as the last stop of our 21 days China and Hong Kong tour from Alberta , Canada. We love this hotel for the location , which is very close to many excellent shopping areas in Mongkok district. We paid $ 89.00 Canadian per room , which was a good bargain. The hotel has free transportation to the Mongkok subway station and the famous Tsimshatsui waterfront. Hong Kong has a very efficient subway system that takes you everywhere you want to go. The hotel airport shuttle bus is only HK $ 89.00 per person , which is less than $ 13.00 Canadian. The hotel has a good Chinese bakery on the ground floor , a good place to buy Chinese buns for breakfast. The Hong Kong Bank is right beside the hotel. The hotel room is small , which is typical of hotel facility in Hong Kong. This hotel has met our travel expectations : clean room , clean bathroom , hot shower , and working air conditioning. If you are looking for good seafood meals in Hong Kong , visit Lei Yue Mun , a former fishing village on the East side of Kowloon. Take the MTR subway to Yau Tong Station , walk into the village , buy fresh seafood from the fish market , and have Sea King Garden Restaurant on -- cook it fresh for you. If you are looking for very good local Cantonese food , visit the tiny Lin &amp ; Chuen Kitchen , -- , Shau Kei Wan , a famous street for small family owned restaurants. Take the subway to Shau Kei Wan Station and Main Street East is close by the Station. Right beside Lin &amp ; Chuen Kitchen on -- is a famous restaurant for fish balls and noodles frequent by Hong Kong TV stars. Across Lin &amp ; Chuen Kitchen is Okonomi , a very good sushi place. Hong Kong is a very clean , safe , and beautiful city with many attractions. The Peak Tram up to Victoria Hill multi-level shops , restaurants , and observation decks overlooking the city and the harbour is a must see , especially at night .

we got a fantastic rate on this hotel and were a little bit aprehensive , but there was no need. The room was quite large and no more dated than other hotels we had stayed in. It was clean and had everything we needed , the staff were friendly and helpful all the time .

the Metropark Kowloon is well placed for MTR and Ladies Market. The hotel is spotless and the staff friendly and helpful .

really enjoyed our stay in the Metropark hotel. A bit grubby in places but you can not fault the cleaness of the rooms. We had breakfast each morning which i must say caters for all taste. Get in early tho as they serve till 11.30 am but most things will have gone by 10.30am. The free bus to the YMCA near the star ferry runs every 1/2 hour. which we found useful although taxi 's are extremley cheap.In the hotel lobby there is a travel office which can sort out many trips around Hong Kong. They were very informative Iris who served us was really professional in her job even calling us in our room 10 mins before our bus was to arrive. If your first time in the area take advantage of these tours , believe me its the best way to see Hong Kong and the other islands.All in all a good and inexpensive hotel if i was to visit Hong Kong , i would without question stay here again .

how the get there : From airport , one can travel by train/bus/taxi. Personally I decided to ride the hotels one shuttle bus which runs every 1 hour , at reasonable cost .

a nice place , and relatively inexpensive , considering how expensive Hong Kong is. Good location , a nice walk to the sights and train station. A little disappointed that the pool was n't open at this time of year , and the restaurants were n't great. But all in all a pleasant enough place for a stopover .

after reading lots of reviews on different hotels in Hong Kong , we finally took a chance on this one. It was our first time in Hong Kong , so it was difficult knowing exactly where we wanted to be. We wanted a reasonably priced hotel for our 8 night stay , from 9/5/2007 , with decent sized rooms , reasonably close to all areas of interest .

just returned from a trip to New Zealand with a stop over in Kowloon Hong Kong .

extremely pleased with this Hotel ! The rates are very reasonable , and the staff are fantastic ! They really go out of their way to make your stay more comfortable and to make sure you have everything you need ! The roof top pool and fitness room are wonderful ! The staff overseeing this area where such a pleasure ! I wish we could have stayed longer just to hang out with them ! The free shuttle services to downtown Hong Kong as well as the night markets were always on time and such a convenience ! The front desk staff are always helpful no matter what you need them to do for you ! If I make it back to Hong Kong , I would n't stay anywhere else ! Extremely pleased ! !

i stayed in the executive rooms at this hotel for five nights in April 2007 , I normally stay in standard rooms but managed to get a good rate which meant for 60 % of the price of other hotels I got a lot of extra stuff executive lounge , free drinks &amp ; snacks at dinner internet access etc

just returned from a 10 day stay at the Metropark Kowloon. Overall a good experience and quite reasonable in a high cost destination .

i stayed at the Metropark for three nights in April. I chose the hotel based on room rate and reviews , and to say it upfront .

stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute

i was very impressed the Metropark Hotel has served their guests. In the beginning we got lost as we went to the wrong Metropark Hotel Address Mongkok , supposed to be in Kowloon , but they are so accomodating that I didnt worried about transferring .

i have stayed in Hong Kong on numerous occasions , and this is about the 5th hotel I have stayed in. I took advantage of a good deal on a week-long stay

this hotel is about a ten minute walk from Mong Kok subway station in northern Kowloon and about 20 minutes walk from the main night market at Temple street. The local area is fantastic , especially at night as some of the little roads crammed with shops are pedestrianised and it 's easy to wander around. It 's also near some of the best day markets .

spent 7 nights here. Hotel a little older than most , more than made up for by the excellent service of the hotel staff. Swimming pool and

i was lucky to find this place on my first visit to Hong Kong last year. I paid about $ 96/night $ 83 rate + taxes/srvc fees . On my airplane ride to HK I sat next to this older gentleman who told me that rooms and hotels in HK were small and pretty pricey. So , when I came across MK hotel I felt really fortunate because my room seemed pretty big to me and the price was fair in comparison to the other hotels that I researched. The room was clean and neat , nice decor , tidy bathroom...there was a pool on the roof and I even got to use their tiny - fits max. 4 people gym a few machines and a treadmill or two . Overall service was friendly and helpful. They also had a free shuttle to the airport and to Tsim Sha Tsui at different times. The hotel is located pretty close maybe 10-15 min walk to the Ladies Market so it 's convenient to do shopping and exploring throughout Mong Kok. My only beef was that there was supposed to be free internet access in the bar downstairs , except that it was n't free because you had to purchase something to sit in there. Overall , Metropark Kowloon is a nice place to stay if you can get a good deal on room rates .

i booked this hotel as hotels in TST were fully booked due to the conventions. As I have never heard of this hotel before , I was rather skeptical .

i was very pleased with my stay at the Metropark Hotel. Even though it was the first day of Chinese New Year , the transfer to the hotel and check in was quick and efficient. The room was comfortable and extremely clean. I read in a previous posting that the bed was hard , and was concerned about this. While firm , it was not too firm. I slept better than in my own bed. They even offer you a choice of pillows. Room service and the cleaning staff were excellent , and the hotel restaurants were also first rate. While I rarely take tours , I was pressed for time , and took advantage of the hotel 's tour office. The two tours I took were great. The tour to China also included a Chinese visa , which made the trip a bargain. While some may feel the location is a bit out of the way , they do have a shuttle service. I never bothered with this , as the metro stop was just a short ten minute stroll away. The location around the hotel is also a sight. While Waterloo Sreet is a quiet oasis for Hong Kong , at least , the Lady 's Market is nearby. Argle Street was a sea of people and made Time 's Square look tame .

stayed here for 1 night prior to leaving for Oz. There were 2 adults and a 5 yr old in our group .

we stayed here for 2 nights in mid january as a stoppover trip to china .

stayed at this hotel for a week and apart from the location , which was a bit disappointing , I have no real complaints about the hotel. Upon arrival the staff were very helpful and took care of our luggage whilst we went to check in , at which we were quickly dealt with. The double room we stayed in was clean and the size was comfortable. We visited the hotel 's two restaurants. The food in the restaurant was excellent and varied and is worth trying. The Sip Sip bar which had a sporty theme offered a good variety of cocktails and provided an opportunity to catch up with Premiership football matches. One tip I would suggest is that if you ever get a taxi back to the hotel make sure you tell the driver that you want to go to the Metropark Hotel Kowloon , as there is another Metropark Hotel nearby .

this Hotel was called the Metropole and still beared the name on parts of the Hotel and stationary/guides etc. It was not luxurious but comfortable , and in Hong Kong you do n't hang around your hotel , you shop or you tour or you are in transit. They are located in amongst the &quot ; dirty&quot ; part of Kowloon called Mongkok , but given that you could walk to the Ladies and Temple St Markets so if you were happy to be amongst the locals it can be interesting. They had a free shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes to the Mongkok Market and down to the Star Ferry so this was handy , but was often full so had to get in early .

after staying at the Metropark Hotel Kowloon Hong Kong we feel we have just had a great value January break .

we stayed at this hotel for two nights on our return from Oz. After reading some of the bad reviews before we went , we were pleasantly surprised with the Metropark , it was we felt worth the 3 stars , and rated much better than some English 3stars we 've stayed in. We had a Standard double room and found it to be a very comfortable size , a queen size bed and a couple of easy chairs , tea/coffee making facilities and a mini bar , which was useful for holding Juice and Milk not to mention beers a nice bathroom. Overall the hotel was spotless and the staff helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast we found excellent value with plenty of choice for all for around Â £ 5.50 per person. The shuttle bus was a convenient way to get to TST and even the walk to Mongkok was n't that far. We had transfers arranged and both ways was easy , uncomplicated and prompt. Only one complaint the Air conditioning in the Dining room was too cold , on our last night we had dinner in our coats. Apart from that top marks we would n't hesitate to recommend it .

i stayed at The Metropark on transit to Oz.. I spent two nights at the hotel. I stayed in an 'executive room ' , the only thing i would say is that i would hate to see a standard room. It wasnt very spacious .

my family of 11 recently stayed at Metropark Kowloon from 2-7 Dec 2006. At first we were happy with the staff , accomodation was decent and the shuttle bus was convenient . However , on the final day my parents went shopping on the morning before checkout and got lost coming back. They were 15 minutes late for the shuttle bus to the hotel and amidst their distress from getting lost and worried about being late to the airport , the staff member who was responsible for checking their room upon checkout verbally abused them to the point of my mum being in tears. He told my father they had to catch a taxi to the airport and that the hotel will not refund the money they had already paid for the shuttle bus back to the airport. As the shuttle bus was awaiting my family to board to take them to the airport , instead of allowing my parents to quickly board , this staff member decided to continuously abuse them and make the people on the bus continue to wait. The language this staff member used was unacceptable and my entire family left with a sour taste for this hotel. It is unfortunate as they enjoyed most things about this hotel. Additionally , when an email was sent to this hotel of this complaint , they failed to address it and have chosen to ignore it. They say that they have a customer-focus policy , but obviously they dont .

we stayed here for 2 nights early December and enjoyed our stay. We arrived early about 10.30am and checked in at executive club and they let us in the room then which was wonderful as we needed the sleep as came from London !

firstly all reviews are subjective and we all have different expectations. We travelled to Hong Kong in November with our 2 year old , just to break up the flight to Australia. We booked an Executive room and airport transfers via the hotel web site all very easy. We chose the hotel having firstly raided the travel agent brochures and then via various reviews. The hotel suited both our budget and location for the 3 nights we stayed. It is close to the tourist areas containing Ladies market/Goldfish street/Bird garden etc. The hotel runs a very regular free transfer minibus here and then onto the Star ferry terminal and back. The hotel is a little dated but the rooms were well presented and kept spotless. The linen was always fresh and clean. The bed was nice and firm , something our daughter insisted on , easier to bounce on ! ! The staff were always attentive and had a smile on their faces. The breakfast buffet was well presented offering a little for all tastes. We felt at the end of the stay that we had made a good choice given the number of hotels around .

we stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for 8 nights in November , and found it to be a very nice hotel. We stayed in a non smoking room , which was very comfortable and clean .

this hotel is not only very poorly located one has to wait for the hourly shuttle to take you anywhere - nothing is in walking distance , but it is also very very old. Everything is outdated , the carpets are musty , paint peeling on the walls , the bathroom counter tops are chipped. The bar downstair is packed with clutter see the picture I took in the bar - how can you relax with the place looking like this ? ! . All in all the hotel is unkempt , dirty-looking and yucky smelling. Whoever came up with the interior decorating must have been on crack - it is uglier than ugly. If you do n't care about hotel cleanliness or good service , but just after a good price , then this place is for you. If you are traveler looking for more classy digs , go somewhere else - you can find a much better hotel for the same price in Hong Kong. And in a better location !

i stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for several days. It appears to be a nice , clean hotel. However , by about the 5th day , I started noticing that I had some small red bumps on my torso. The next day , several more appeared. The day after I left the hotel , the bumps developed into welts all over my arms , waist , shoulders and legs -- about 25 in total. After doing some research , I realize these are bed bug bites. Sometimes it can take up to 9 days for these bites to appear , so I was probably being bitten a little every night without knowing it. If you stay at this hotel , be very careful. Check the bed sheets , blankets and mattress to make sure your room is not infested with bed bugs. You also have to make sure they do n't get onto your luggage or chothes or you could end up infesting your home with them .

i stayed at the Metropark Kowloon for a few nights recently .

room was very good for the money. Paid $ 58 US dollars a night , so search for a bargain at the different hotel sites because they all have a different rate for the same hotel. I thought the breakfast buffet was disgusting pretty much and overpriced. The hotel is located about 10 min walk to the mtr station. I would likely stay there again for that price .

we have now stayed at the Metropark Hotel Kowloon , formerly the Metropole 6 times increasing our length of stay each time , until we have now just returned from a 30 night stay .

we stayed at the MetroPark Kowloon for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. 25 Sept to 28 Sept 2006

i stayed here for 4nights from the 20th-24th of September .

i checked into the hotel on 21st Sept and checked yesterday. The whole stay in the hotel was smooth. The hospitable services provided by the hotel made me feel so much at home. I was always greeted by the room service lady when I first step out of my room every morning with &quot ; zou san&quot ; -Good morning and a warm smile. :

stayed at the Metropark Hotel in Kowloon for 10 nights and had no problems. I 've read some bad reviews on this site about it but can not understand why. The staff were very helpful , the room non-smoking/Executive was very clean. The pool was large and the in-house food was good. The only negative 's I could point out was that the gym was very small and the location a bit inconvienent not close to any MTR stations but for the money you pay , you cant expect too much. The hotel offered a free shuttle but for me , it didnt help that much as the drop-off locations were limited to 2 stops only. If you want to be in the heart of the city - this is not the hotel to stay in. Its in a quiet area but good for families as its close to a supermarket and hospital .

unlike the previous reviewer I can understand why some people gave this hotel a bad review. However I can also understand why some people would think it 's not all that terrible. I think it all depends on the timing of your visit and therefore the amount you pay for your room. For my part , I unfortunately scheduled my trip to Hong Kong during a big convention and therefore hotel prices were increased to quite ludicrous amounts. I can â   t say this was the fault of the hotel as every other hotel I tried to book at this time was either more expensive or fully booked. Given this situation , I was forced to pay probably twice the amount I would have ordinarily paid for the same room had I had the foresight to travel either 2 weeks earlier or later .

just stayed 4 nights in Metropark and would not agree with ANY negative comments I read on this forum. Everything was exactly as promised The room was airy clean comfortable and well serviced The TV worked the programmes were poor but I did not come to HK to see TV The breakfasts were excellent and on special well worth the money. The shuttle bus was very handy and always on time. The staff were friendly helpful and very polite. The swim and gym area was good and well served , It IS a 15 minute walk to Mon Kokl MTR if you do not wait for the shuttle bus but what does that matter at the price paid for such an excellent standard of hotel this walk is ok by me. helps to wwear off the excellent food My flight was at midnight but I kept the room until 12 they stored my luggage and gave me towels and all requirements in the swimming pool showers for me to change at the last moment before taking the China Travel shuttle bus to the airport - arranged via the hotel and very reasonable. Speaking with swimmers in the sun - one couple were on their 6th trip - they stayed each year for one months - this says it all .

just returned from one night stop over in Hong Kong. This hotel is dirty , very smelly. The smell in the room was almost unbearable. Staff were not helpful. Shuttle bus was not pointed out to us. Tourist sightseeing reservations lady has attitude. Would never stay again .

we stayed at this hotel for two weeks during our first visit to Hong Kong. As a family of 4 we had two rooms both of which were very clean and had all the amenities needed .

do n't EVER go to this hotel , it is a complete and utter rip-off .

where do you start .

good value , good location , all that 's been written by others is true. What does make it different for me is as follows :

modest prices , nice restaurants , a very good bar. The Hotel has a regular free bus service to the most interesting parts of the city. The service is excellent. Free safe in the room. Nice , but little swimming pool at the top of the building , with a view. Good bussines longue. Bus service to the airport at reasonable price 90 HKD . Trip advisor in the Hotel. Recommended .

my husband and I stayed at the Metropole , HK from 28 May until 09 June and we could n't find fault with this hotel at all. Our room on the 16th floor was extremely clean and very comfortable. Please do not be put off by what you read as it is all about personal taste. The Hotel is in a v good location and Mongkok is only a 10 mins walk to the markets and shops and metro station. The free courtesy bus provides a link to Mongkok and Tsim Shat Sui which is handy for the Star Ferry terminal and for some shopping at the bottom of Nathan Rd. Please try Teresa 's Coffee Restaurant next to the hotel as they are very friendly and the food is good and very cheap. Buy an Octopus card from Mongkok Train Station it cost $ 150 but is extremely good value as you can use it on the metro , some shops accept it as well as some Fast Food outlets such as McD 's. You also get cheaper fares on the metro and it contains a refundable deposit of $ 50 albeit there a small handling fee which they deduct saves the hassle of having change. You can top it up at any metro station. A brilliant holiday in a Fab city .... we hope to return again in the near future

my wife and i stayed at the Metropole from 28 May to 11 June and had a great time there .

we had a very pleasant stay at the Metropole Hotel in Kowloon from 28th May to the 2nd June 2006. After reading other reviews about this hotel we took the advice given and upgraded to an excecutive room , hich was very worthwhile. A very good breakfast was included in the upgrade price of Â £ 14 per room per night , also 2 bottles of water each day was left in the room. It allows a quicker check in and out as there is a separate excecutive lounge. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The only faults we could find were that the bed was a little too firm for my liking and the coffee and creamer left in the room each day to use with the supplied kettle , were of very cheap quality and were awful. I would advise anyone to take their own coffee with them. All in all we found this to be a good 3 star hotel and good value for money .

we stayed at the hotel in 2 spells of 4 nights each at the end of May and in all honesty the hotel needs a complete refurbishment. We stayed in a non smoking executive room on the 16th floor and found the room to be in need of a complete overhaul. The wallpaper was old and peeling in places , the carpet looked old with a number of stains , again the bathroom really needed updating and the shower had terrible water pressure. The room was not executive standard .

good points :

we stayed here 4 nights in the Executive non-smoking room 16th floor . We were very surprised by size of the room which we were expecting to be smaller. There is no need to stay in the Executive Deluxe room - the Executive room is about the same and cheaper. The rooms were totally smoke free. If you stay in the Executive rooms you do n't need to check in at the 1st floor registration but can go directly to the 17th floor for priority check in. The included buffet breakfast is available on the 17th floor Executive lounge or in the restaurant. It is adequate - not the best but not the worst either. The rooms are very quiet. The location was more convenient than we had anticipated. The train / MTR are a 10 minute walk away , or you can take the free hotel shuttle .

found this hotel to be excellent in terms of service , cleanliness and room standard. Main problem is with location and that is resolved , to a certain extent , by the hotel laying on a shuttle bus to Tsim Tsa Shui and back at regular intervals .

have stayed here 3 times now. It beats the other 4 &amp ; 5 star hotels in the area .

the hotel service was quite good , room was very clean. The location is in middle of Mong Kok-- great if you know Hong Kong very well , otherwise I advice you to stay near TST area .

ok , so the title to this review probably leads you to believe I did n't like this hotel. Well , you 'd be right but I 'd like to start off by saying that the Metropole or MetroSARS , as it is affectionately known was n't too bad and it was pretty cheap - you get what you pay for after all. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on the third and final leg of our honeymoon. When we arrived we had to wait 20 minutes to check-in because of the queues. When we got to our room we found it was a twin room naturally we had booked a double and it absolutely stank of smoke we 'd booked a non-smoking room . The unhelpful staff at reception only changed their attitude when I became very angry and we were eventually given another room which did meet our specifications. I could now tell you a long story about our incredibly rude bell boy , but suffice to say that he was not very nice. At all. On a brighter note , our new room was ok. A little dark and a little small but adequate. It was n't until night time that we found out that the Metropole really skimped when buying the pillows - they were filled with sawdust maybe not but it seemed that way and were highly unpleasant. So bad in fact , that we actually went out and bought our own ! We did n't eat at the hotel as it was expensive and we did n't hold out hope that it would be any good considering how we 'd found the rest of the hotel. And don â   t bank on using the pool as it â   s only open for around half the year. The location was ok - good for shopping with many street markets nearby running until late at night. You may have heard that the SARS outbreak started here. Well , it 's true and in fact they managed to trace the outbreak to the lift area on the 5th floor. I for one could n't have thought of a more appropriate place ! Overall , do not stay at this hotel unless it is very , very cheap .

stayed in this hotel just before christmas. We upgraded to a room on the executive floor of the hotel , which gave us a fairly spacious room which was of a reasonable standard , but in fairness for the price we paid we were more than happy with what we had. The room price also had breakfast included which was very nice. The shuttle bus ran from the hotel regularly , and the hotel bar on the ground floor was ok for a relaxing drink. The service was good and the staff were friendly. Cabs around the city are cheap which makes the hotels location easily accessible to the main sites of the city .

when I first heard this was the hotel where SARS virus first broke out I was pretty worried and thought about changing out hotel...but it was actually OK. The rooms were decent and clean , there is also a safety deposit box in the room .

we 'd read mixed reviews on this hotel and that it was &quot ; out of the way&quot ; . Upon arrival we were pleasanly surprised that the hotel was very pleasant in a so-so area . The rooms were perfectly fine and clean. The bar and it 's limited menu is expensive - in fact eating was a problem in Hong Kong full stop ! The hotel also has a roof garden with a freezing pool , and a small gym .

we stayed at the Metropole for three nights from 16 November. Our 'superior ' rooms basic but very clean. Great shower. Minibar prices abit high so would buy our essentials across the road at the Wellcome store. The Metropole is very convenient for shopping in Argyle Street. Some great stores to be found here. Quick access also to the Ladies Market. Frequented the Bakery - nice pastries ! Housekeeping staff very friendly and obliging. Only used complimentary shuttle once but very handy and punctual. Our room had a safe in it but friend 's next door did n't. Because of having so many heavy bags , we opted to use their Airport shuttle bus. Very luxurious indeed. Cost was HK $ 85. Good value. Would definitely stay here again .

stayed Nov 12th for four nights in an 'executive ' room which I think is well worth the small difference in cost .
