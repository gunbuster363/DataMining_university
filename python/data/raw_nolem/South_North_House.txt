south &amp ; North House is just at the back of Prudential Hotel &amp ; only 5 minutes by foot to mtr &amp ; Nathan road and the temple st. market is just a stone away. This is a very secured guest house with security guard at the lobby at the ground floor with 24-hour circuit tv. Our room is basic but with a small refrigerator , television , hot &amp ; cold shower and computer unit. Aside from cleaning the room , they also changed the bed sheets &amp ; towels daily .

i stayed in this traveler 's motel &quot ; House with my parents for 6 nights recently. This motel is run by an old chinese lady with her son. They understand mandarin and the son can speak some broken English - so language is not really a problem especially for Asian travelers .
