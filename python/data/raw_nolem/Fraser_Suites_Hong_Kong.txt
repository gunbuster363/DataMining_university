this is a brand new Service Residence opened some time in Aug-08. The rooms are compact as it is anywhere in HongKong. The interiors are very well made with all the latest household electronics and equipments .

we stay and are still staying here till we find a permanent place to rent. When we look around the HK apartments to rent , I think staying in a serviced apartment like Fraser Suites is significantly more comfortable. Even when it comes to travellng for leisure , service apartments is an attractive proposition for a home away from home. The Frasers Suite is the epitome of a refurbished building and a product of Urban Renewal in Wanchai .
