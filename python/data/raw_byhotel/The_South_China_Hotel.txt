take the bus from airport , will drop you directly at hotel doorstep second last stop . the room be small , well compare to other hk hotel for this price be okay . there be   of us in this trip so be rather waste to rend another room all by myself , we add a bed which cost   per night but when the time we check out   day later it only charge me for one
