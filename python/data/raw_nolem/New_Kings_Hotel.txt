this hotel is located in the yau ma tei area where there are many cheap hotels cheap relative to hong kong . We were pleased enough with what we received for HK $ 500 - a clean looking decent foyer and reception , decent clean rooms , comfortable bed .

we chose this hotel because of its location to MTR since we came in late at night and we had no reservations. We got the room at an expensive price but since we are tired , we checked in .

my friend gelo whom we met in macau suggested new king 's hotel to stay , i checked in with my friend for 3nights from oct 14-17,2008. the room is small but clean , bed is not that soft but could be a refuge after a day 's tiring tour. toilet is clean with bathtub. the receptionists are cool and always ready to be of help for directions , limited english though. our room was daily fixed. the most advantageous part of the hotel is its location. convenient stores around , bus stations steps away and the yau ma tei mtr is just 2mins walk. for me it was a blessing i discovered new king 's holtel , surely i will be back there .

last month , I went to hongkong with my boyfriend for 3 nights. And we decided for a budget hotel that location is near MRT. So most of hotel that we looking for is on Nathan .
