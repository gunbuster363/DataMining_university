very good value for money. The hotel is slightly far from the main tourist attractions but in a very nice neighbourhood with restaurants , shops and anything you might need. The rooms are of decent size for Hong kong and full of light plus they offer a good range of complimentary bath products and drinks that make the stay pleasant and provide a service above the price you are paying. Staff is also quite helpful .
