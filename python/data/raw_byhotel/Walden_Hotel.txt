the room be tiny , but the location be superb , close to everything . perfect for solo traveller

location and size be ok it you consider about the price    i book one week via www ctrip com and when i check in they tell me that they have upgrade me to deluxe room    great ! ! ! but the room be the same only higher floor

no complaint on this one . not a place for someone who cant sleep in traffic sound , but you get the excellent central location for reasonable price on the other side . free inroom internet connection be also a plus

we â € ˜ have just return from our   week trip to hk     thailand . we stay   night at walden hotel and for the price we pay and what be include   the hotel be n't as bad as the previous poster mentioned . we be   adult and pay for an extra cot

we arrive at this hotel and realize that we be be robbed . the     deluxe    rooms be simply tiny rooms locate on higher floors . for   usd a night , we have a room , that with an extra bed have little room to walk . the     view    from this expensive room be junky . we be shock at what we have reserve and decide to pack up and leave and head to the airport two days early . the desk staff have little to say , other than contact book agent and tell them . the     standard    rate be not available . their solution be to give us three rooms and waive the extra cot fee . this solution would cost of   usd a night for two rooms , instead of   usd . they be unwilling to accomodate us in any way . although this be a clean , tidy little room in a convenient location , the price be way overblown . i say , run for your life and do n't let the websiter fool you
