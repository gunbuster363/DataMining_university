i stayed here with my sister on our recent trip to HongKong. We were on a budget and needed a decent hotel that is near to Disneyland the Disneyland hotels were over our budget .

the hotel looks great on internet but there 's nothing to do around. You have to take a bus to go to the nearest subway station.. .

this plcae was the pits. Dont fall for the nice pictures of the &quot ; biggest pool in South East Asia&quot ; Nothing here is free. Pool entry $ 20 as they apparently dont own it , the adjoining property does . &quot ; Sky garden&quot ; - non existent with a couple of low lying planter boxes and some out-of-use fountains. common areas-none , Service- none , air conditioning- none , even the ventillation system was turned off and small stickers placed on the windows explaining how they are unable to be opened due to fire regulations ie bolted up . The hallways smelled like urine , not even water was provided for free , although there was one vending machine .

my stay in this hotel was a terrible memory. The room was unbelievably small , even by the standard of Hong Kong hotels. There was no airconditioner in cold winter. And the whole hotel was flooded with mainland tourists. This is a low-standard hotel with unsatisfactory service. I will never book it again .

the rooms smell like I was going to hospital. The size of the rooms was extremely small. I am 5 &quot ; 10&quot ; but when I lay down on the bed my foot touch the wall. The Smallest and Smelliest rooms / hotel I have ever stayed in. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .

we arrived in HK at 3am , took a taxi and checked in Rambler Garden , it is about 20 mins from Airport. We did not expect much of the hotel as we just wanted a short night stay before we depart to Disneyland. Rambler seems to be the only choice which is located not too far from Disneyland .

we stayed here for a few nights in May and can honestly say we would never return .
