a charming b    b locate in an ideal location on cheung chau , close to a beach and the ferry pier . small rooms but keep clean by a friendly staff . ideal for short stay although we live comfortably for   days . a small but tasty breakfast menu give a choice of both local and western meals . also of note be the roof terrace which give a lovely view over the delightful island of cheung chau . will use again

the cheung chau b     b also know as the tung wan guest house be locate on one of the hong kong outer island   min ferry ride . we stay two night and find it a great value . locate only some   yard from the ferry terminal . the rooms be small but ultra efficient , clean and modern . breakfast western be minimal but adequate not a place you would linger over breakfast . but who would want to when there be so much good , cheap , food around and lots to see . there be a night attendant and they happily provide us with a carafe of boil water early mornings . cheerful and efficient staff . overall a great value . cheung chau island be just delightful . you can immerse yourself in an authentic community . the b     b , apparently a novel concept on the island , be a first rate , budget value . recommend , but be prepare for the tiny rooms . if you can get it , pay for the larger unit . apparently avoid the island on weekend of hk holiday , when it 's very crowd
