we made a mistake by not reading the reviews before booking this hotel. The room was FILTHY. Small and cramped , which is ok by hongkong standards. However , what was not acceptable was the Dirty Sheets strands of hair and stained , Filthy toilet which had used sanitary pads on the floor. You bathe right beside the toilet bowl and the sink. It is UNBEARABLE .

read the reviews here before you book ! . Hotel is budget and the rooms are incredibly small - in fact i laughed out loud when i opened the door .

the hotel room is the smaller room i have ever seen of all the hotel i have stayed before , i opened the door and just 1 step i can reach the bed , the bathroom is even smaller. But i have to say the location is good and with the price i paid maybe this is what i can get in hongkong .

it was not supposed to be but our travel agency has no choice but to book us in this hotel because according to the agency all hotels was fully booked. We were hesitant to check-in in this hotel based on some feedbacks. Now I know why they are... .

i stayed for 5 nites in this hotel. price was nice and stuff was friendly. BUT what i was suprised @ this hotel is the room ! ! ! too small window and narrow bathroom .

when I opened the door , I knew I made a wrong decision because it 's too small and uncomfortable. It 's worst experience and I had to book another hotel for staying .

apart from location everything else was horrible about hotel , usually staff were nice but one hotel receptionist who checked me in and checked out was just rude for some reason. Rest rooms sucked See Pictures , small , cramped up , no windows , very dirty even from Indian standards .

excellent location and good price. The rooms are really , really small , but the real problem were the bathroom conditions , which were n't too nice kind of dirty . Staff was nice and helpful .
