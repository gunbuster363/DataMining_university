i stayed for 2 nightmares.... room very tiny , there was no space to open my luggage , no space between the bed and wall , the toilet was a joke. No walls , only a glass window , and the lightbulb was broken , so I had to shower on the dark. I called the reception , they said that there was no light there... They ca n't undestand and speak english. Never go there....The pictures on internet are faked. And the prices are high .

when entering the room , we were shocked by its small size , the stain in the linen and the hair ! ! between the towels. Failing to cancel our booking with the travel agent , we had to stay at the hotel for 6 consecutive nights. Upon request , we were given promptly another room , which was clean and slightly bigger estimated &lt ; 10 sq m including bathroom for HKD 550 .

we booked this hotel after reading the trip advisor reviews for the original hotel we had booked those were very bad . We stayed here for about fourteen nights in two-five night windows in between travels to other parts of Asia .

hotel 36 is a new 160 room hotel which opened in December 2006. It is located in the Mongkok area and is very close to the Prince Edward MTR subway station .
