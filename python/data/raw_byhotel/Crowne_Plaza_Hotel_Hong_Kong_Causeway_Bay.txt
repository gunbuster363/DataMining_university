i be not sure if i shoud book a room in this hotel , bacause of lack of opinion   i find only two of them . today   i be sure that it be great decision   nice , well equip , modern and new room be a nice surprice . frendly staff and great view from roof bar be the same like photo present

not too pricy in terms of   star hotel in hong kong

the hotel be   star , nicer than i think a crowne plaza would be perhaps they have upgrade the brand . although the lobby be small and modest , the rooms be plenty roomy , and that include the bathroom too . everything be brand new at this time , and the service be excellent to boot

i have stay at several hotel in the causeway bay area , and i must say that my stay at the new crowne plaza be the best one yet ! it 's quite new , open just   week ago , so everything be still fresh

we have a pleasant stay there . the room and service be great . the location be good , very close to times square where they be plenty of shopping and eat , and subway entrance . good room size , very nice design with glass shower stall that can see through to the room but can be close with wall panel for privacy . they be still work out a few minor kink since it just open but overall i would have give a   star if it be n't for the     scam    at checkout . when we checkout , the clerk ask if we 'd like to lock in the us   rate so we do n't have to wait for our credit card to convert as the rate change daily . we think that would be good so we go ahead and accept their us rate . in hindsight , we should have ask what be the conversation rate they used . it turn out to be   , far from the average of   in fact , our credit card use   so do n't fall for that pitch about locking in your conversation rate ! ! ! that 's the only reason i give a   start
