nice view. Very clean. Within walking distance to many sites. But other than that , The room was small , the bed was hard as a rock and they didnt have many ammenities. If you are looking for a nice view for a good price and you walk so much every day that you are to exhausted to notice the hard bed or you wo n't be spending a lot of time in your room , then it is a good choice .
