we booked a 4 beds in a 8-bed room. Finally , they gave us a private room for 4 people with bathroom. The room was extremly small. Firstly , it looked clean but soon we realized it is not that clean. Definitely , the room had bed bugs. The best thing is its excelent location. The price was okey - comparing to other offers .
