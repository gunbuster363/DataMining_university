i stay here with my sister on our recent trip to hongkong . we be on a budget and need a decent hotel that be near to disneyland the disneyland hotel be over our budget

the hotel look great on internet but there 's nothing to do around . you have to take a bus to go to the nearest subway station  

this plcae be the pits . not fall for the nice picture of the     biggest pool in south east asia    nothing here be free . pool entry     as they apparently not own it , the adjoin property do .     sky garden      non existent with a couple of low lie planter box and some out of use fountains . common areas none , service  none , air conditioning  none , even the ventillation system be turn off and small sticker place on the windows explain how they be unable to be open due to fire regulation ie bolt up . the hallway smell like urine , not even water be provide for free , although there be one vending machine

my stay in this hotel be a terrible memory . the room be unbelievably small , even by the standard of hong kong hotels . there be no airconditioner in cold winter . and the whole hotel be flood with mainland tourists . this be a low standard hotel with unsatisfactory service . i will never book it again

the rooms smell like i be go to hospital . the size of the rooms be extremely small . i be           but when i lie down on the bed my foot touch the wall . the smallest and smelliest rooms   hotel i have ever stay in . i would not recommend this hotel to anyone

we arrive in hk at   , take a taxi and check in rambler garden , it be about   min from airport . we do not expect much of the hotel as we just want a short night stay before we depart to disneyland . rambler seem to be the only choice which be locate not too far from disneyland

we stay here for a few night in may and can honestly say we would never return
