for     +     hkd a night , this be an unbeatable deal just min walk away from lan kwai fong , central , hong kong . pro   a + location , spacious room with cooking facility simple but adequate and microwave , friendly and helpful staff , nice view overlook mid levels we be on   floor , cable internet be free of charge in the room . con   concierge not always open , not a luxurious hotel by any means , very simple entrance area , must take taxi to doorstep if you have lots of luggage locate on a slope   ca n't really walk it , carpet be stain and a little dirty

i want somewhere in central which be reasonably price and be not disappointed . this be not a hotel with lobby , facility etc but a quiet , simple studio to sleep in if you plan to be out all day . the shower be enormous and it be useful to have a kettle and small fridge . the bed be a small double . i be wary of the air condition after reading the previous review but in the heat and humidity , i do not find it too ferocious . the staff on reception be helpful and if you want simplicity in a great location , then i recommend ice house

stay for a week in july . excellent location , right in the heart of hong kong 's central , near all the bars , ferry terminal , peak tram , soho , mtr station , tram line etc . a hide gem
