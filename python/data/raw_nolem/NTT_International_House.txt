stayed at the NTT house in December 2008 - in a so called suite with my family. It was 1600 HKD per night , that is around 160 EURO , not too cheap for university dorm. The suite was rather nice , but the kitchen was very worn-down and under-equipped just three plates and four different cups... thats all ! ! ! , only with fridge and microwave... not too useful... What are reasons for my low grade , are two things : firstly , they have very strict rules about house rules , but no one seem to enforce this rules , as the noise in other rooms and in the hallways is untorelable especially during late night hours and no one reacts if you make a complaint ; secondly , if you are not Chinese , you have problems communicating with staff , as their English is basic at best , and thirdly , TV programs are almost all in Chinese , expect of two programs that are part-English and several non-interesting &quot ; international&quot ; programms Bloomberg , Deutsche Welle , RAI . They could do a lot better offering more English based TV chanells. Not everybody is Chinese ! !

this accommodation is a university/college residence , but considerably nicer than most dorms I â € ™ ve been exposed to when I was in school. Staying at a place like this helps for budget travelers as it is cheaper , but still â € ¦ .you are paying about $ 100 CAN/night for a university dorm setting .
