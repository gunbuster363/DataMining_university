for $ 600 + 10 % HKD a night , this is an unbeatable deal just mins walk away from Lan Kwai Fong , Central , Hong Kong. Pros : A + location , spacious room with cooking facilities simple but adequate and microwave , friendly and helpful staff , nice view overlooking mid-levels we were on 7th floor , cable internet is free of charge in the room. Cons : Concierge not always open , not a luxurious hotel by any means , very simple entrance area , must take taxi to doorstep if you have lots of luggage located on a slope - ca n't really walk it , carpet is stained and a little dirty .

i wanted somewhere in Central which was reasonably priced and was not disappointed. This is not a hotel with lobby , facilities etc but a quiet , simple studio to sleep in if you plan to be out all day. The shower was enormous and it was useful to have a kettle and small fridge. The bed is a small double. I was wary of the air conditioning after reading the previous review but in the heat and humidity , I did not find it too ferocious. The staff on reception were helpful and if you want simplicity in a great location , then I recommend Ice House .

stayed for a week in july. excellent location , right in the heart of hong kong 's central , near all the bars , ferry terminal , peak tram , soho , mtr station , tram line etc. a hidden gem .
