this hotel is what you would expect by &quot ; no frills&quot ; , dont expect any service. The rooms were ok clean , the toilet was weird , when you flush the colour of the water isnt very pleasant , i think it uses recycled water. Also the towels had stains on them , so i recommend you bring your own. The toiletries were like sample pack sizes and i recommend to bring your own too .

i booked a triple sharing which comes with a double bed plus a single bed from 19/3 till 22/3. Very happy with the arrangement. The check in was fast HOWEVER

as the title suggest , this is a no frills , simple , basic hotel. In fact , it 's a commercial building turned hotel. When you are the footstep of the building , it resembles a typical old HK style office building lobby. To get to the hotel reception , you have to take the lift to next level .
