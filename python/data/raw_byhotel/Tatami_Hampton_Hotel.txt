we make a mistake by not reading the review before book this hotel . the room be filthy . small and cramp , which be ok by hongkong standards . however , what be not acceptable be the dirty sheet strand of hair and stain , filthy toilet which have use sanitary pad on the floor . you bathe right beside the toilet bowl and the sink . it be unbearable

read the review here before you book ! . hotel be budget and the rooms be incredibly small   in fact i laugh out loud when i open the door

the hotel room be the smaller room i have ever see of all the hotel i have stay before , i open the door and just   step i can reach the bed , the bathroom be even smaller . but i have to say the location be good and with the price i pay maybe this be what i can get in hongkong

it be not suppose to be but our travel agency have no choice but to book us in this hotel because accord to the agency all hotel be fully booked . we be hesitant to check in in this hotel base on some feedbacks . now i know why they are   

i stay for   nites in this hotel . price be nice and stuff be friendly . but what i be suprised   this hotel be the room ! ! ! too small window and narrow bathroom

when i open the door , i know i make a wrong decision because it 's too small and uncomfortable . it 's worst experience and i have to book another hotel for stay

apart from location everything else be horrible about hotel , usually staff be nice but one hotel receptionist who check me in and check out be just rude for some reason . rest rooms suck see picture , small , cramp up , no windows , very dirty even from indian standard

excellent location and good price . the rooms be really , really small , but the real problem be the bathroom conditions , which be n't too nice kind of dirty . staff be nice and helpful
