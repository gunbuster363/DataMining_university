this is the right kind of hotel for a certain kind of traveller. This hotel is meant for those who are looking for basic , clean , affordable , no frills accomodation in a convenient location .

the service is Terrible and room is super small. They have old guys at the front who were rude and even mean when I asked for a receipt on the last day when I leave... And never gave me a receipt. They have prostitutes standing in the front of the hotel and the pimp is a lady running a restaurant at the same corner , whom also know all the businesses on the street... it almost seems they are all &quot ; connected&quot ; .... I know for $ US 50 per night in HK , I ca n't expect much but this is a Hotel actually a motel I would never go back even as a single male traveler .
