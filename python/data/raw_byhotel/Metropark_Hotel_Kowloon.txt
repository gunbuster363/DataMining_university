either someone mess up with the rating or i be dupe by my agent ! the only good thing about this hotel be its location , which be near to one of the most popular shopping area in kowloon call lady market . my take on this hotel

i base my choice of hotel on location and try to minimise walk during the evenings . be aware that there be   metroparks in the mongkok area . i get it a bit wrong ! the metropark mongkok be north of the main shopping area close the the prince edward mtr and the other one be the metropark kowloon with be on waterloo rd and quite a walk to the mongkok mtr . so if you plan on use the mtr much in hk it 's a good idea then be sure your hotel be close to a station

the hotel be lovely   just a shame it be so far from hong kong harbour . the traffic be murder and rush hour . the hotel offer a free shuttle bus to the shopping area and the harbour every half hour . there be a sightsee tour desk within the hotel , where the staff be very helpful . plenty for everyone at the breakfast buffet . the swim pool be warm and

our good experience with this hotel start a week before we arrive when i ask by e mail for baby cot . i be reply promptly with a confirmation even though they do not yet receive my book , this be nice . the staff proceed to be nice and helpful throughout our stay

what a wonderful hotel , the cleanliness be first class , the food be excellent and the staff could not do enough for you , there be a free bus down to the harbour and the last one return at   pm

hotel be conveniently locate ,about   minutes cab from victoria and well connect by hotel bus form international airport and with local bus  taxi services at doorstep

stay for   days with my daughter and granddaughter and the staff be excellent . the room be a twin bed with an extra bed

have stay in hong kong a few times over the years we think we would give this hotel a chance . the hotel and staff can not be criticise , the room be excellent as be the service . the room be clean and in good condition , we stay in a refurbish room on the   floor and have a spacious comfort room which be a really good size . the shuttle bus be a god send however more than once we be turn away as it be full and find we have to come down and sit in the bus more than   minutes before it be due to leave , often with the air condition turn off ! although the hotel can not be fault next time we will be stay on hong kong island , almost definitely with the same chain

this hotel be part of the chinese metropark group , and have stay in the metropark in xiamen i be a bit disappoint with the size of the room here , but perhaps that 's just the way things be in hong kong . otherwise the hotel have be recently refurbish you sink into the corridor carpet and be generally a pleasant place to stay . the bed be soft by chinese standards . good choice of tv channels inc bbc world

a lovely hotel in a good location . friendly staff , exceptionally clean , great breakfast     good value

our stay at the metropark be great . the room be a little small but it be very clean , comfortable and probably the go size for hong kong . the buffet breakfast each morning be delicious with good choice to suit everyone 's tastes . although it be a bit off the main area , the hotel shuttle bus be excellent and frequent so we never feel stranded . monkok shopping area and market be within easy walk distance as be monkok mtr station . all the staff be friendly and helpful and could n't do enough when one of our companion be sick and need a doctor . we would most definately stay there again if we go back to hong kong

i pick this hotel because it seem to be good value at a reasonable price . i be n't quite clear on quite where kowloon be in relation to hong kong island . its a bus trip for most people , but the hotel operate a free bus service , so its no issue , and its quite close to mong kok . there be also a tour operator day trip etc thats base at the hotel , so get out and about be easy and safe

good price and quite spacious for an aisan hotel . clean with adequate space . the furniture be date but ok . also get to get use to a harder bed since it be in asia . service be ok but not excellent . location be in an older area but still quite safe and conveniently locate near lots of bus and subway stations . make travel to hong kong island another place easy . walk distance to lady street , mong kowk and a few other things . resturants , cafe 's , bakery and laundry facility near by if you 'll be there for a bit . we be there for   week and do n't regret it . not a romantic place but great if you 're go to be out most of the day and just need a place to stay . free website be good . the picture on the website be probably of rooms that have be recently renovate as ours do n't look as nice . the pool be also very small , especially for have be renovate recently . all in all , we do n't regret go there . i 'd recommend it if you 're not picky and not look for a romatic elgegant place

the hotel just do not look impressive from the outside    but the minute you step in and into the rooms , u really begin to like it

we stay in this metropark for two week in november   , with another couple who have stay there in   , recommend it to us . our stay here,in a club room , help to make our visit a truly memorable occasion . we find all the staff member we come into contact with during our stay to be very friendly and extremely helpful . our breakfast in the club lounge be first class and pleasantly varied we particularly enjoy the congee . our only other meal take frequently in the hotel be in the sipsip bar and we both enjoy all our meal there especially the fish and chips to die for and the nasi goreng ! ! the shuttle bus be a real bonus as be the airport transfer . locally we use the wellcome supermarket across the street the   just to your right on leave the hotel and carry on a bit further the first laundry on the corner give an excellent service at a bargain price the staff in the nearby watson chemist to the right be very helpful . we find that get and use the octupus card be a great tip and we would recomend use the mtr as often as possible { much easier and more friendly than the london underground } and with stop near every place you be likely to go . i should also mention that we use theresa 's cafe chinese with english menu and food and service that belie the external look ! i will say that we be go back to hong kong and the metropark for   days,later this year . our niece stay here for   days in june   on her way to australia and as a single female traveller thoroughly enjoy her stay here . we would really like to thank all the staff of the metropole for make us so welcome but especially anita hang , raymond cater manager and all the girl in the sipsip bar particularly win win bar captain and mirra and also our room keeper

from the outside , the metropark kowloon do n't harbour anything interesting . it sink into the background of kowloon with the rest of the terrace building that seem to mirror each other throughout the area

stay here a couple of night en route to perth wa . all in all good service but the breakfast buffet be a bit crowd and they be slow to top up item that be miss from the buffet . the in house bar be be pricey so use the seven eleven down the road to the right if you want bottled water etc . room be clean , a bit small but have all the usual things you would expect , iron , hair dryer etc

my sister and i stay at this hotel for   night and get a fantastic deal through hotels .ca . from the airport we take the airport express and arrive at kowloon station , from there we take the free airport hotel shuttle bus   which take you directly to the hotel , both of which be excellent

take the upgrade to the metropark club floor . bigger room , personalise service , specialise check in , turn down service , breakfast include and more . great value hotel for hong kong . mtr less than   min walk , mongkok , mongkok east , give access to kowloon , hong kong island , and more . close to the mongkok market , goldfish , lady , computer market etc , and nathan road . good offer in the 'house ' restaurants . would recommend to friend , and will use again

my wife and i stay at the metro park hotel on waterloo rd , the service and cleanliness of the hotel be worth its money . its be cetainly worth while upgrade when you arrive . a courtsy bus be porvided and make get about a lot easier .

we stay   night and although the room be small it be clean and all we really needed . the hotel run a shuttle bus which we use on numerous occasions and find it very good as would have be a fortune in taxis to and from the harbour front

just get back from my trip in hk . i stay here during my last   night , and despite the location , i must say i do n't regret my stay here at all

stay one night here after   night at novotel kowloon . in terms of location , it be quite poorly locate   nothing to do within walk distance , no place to shop and limited place to eat . make up greatly by free hotel shuttle to mongkok   minutes by foot and new world place skip this place , waste of time

this be a very good value for money hotel the breakfast be especially good

i and my lovely wife stay at this property for only one night after have try a hostel in the world  in famous chongking mansion a must , really !   would . we be look for something cheap , and this hotel be quite cheap by hk standards . but that 's all . it give us a us motel feeling , nothing much . at the time it seem a big change from the place we stay at at the     mansion    , but now , think about it carefully , well    it be n't that good at all

we stay at metropark for   night en route to australia . the hotel be situate in kowloon and be in the middle of the build up area so no real view of any note from the hotel . we be two adult and a child   book into a standard room

what a nice hotel . staff where really friendly and helpful . the room be a bit small but very very nice . be more like a   * hotel than just a   they need to re * this . lol restaurant be stunning . pool be clean and same as the gym . free shuttle to the town   harbour area as well as back to the airport . be a truly great end to our round the world trip

stay   night mid august . hotel basically sound . rooms on small side but well furnish and no complaints . stay on exec floor   incl breakfast , business centre and light food drink each evening . would have appreciate more selection and daytime tea coffee etc

arrive here at the beginning of our honeymoon and be n't sure what to expect . i know we would n't be get panoramic view of the harbour , but then we do n't want to be stick in our room just look out of the window

we stay here for   nights . the hotel be locate in a more traditional area of hong kong , so do n't go expect it to be too western . however , close proximity to metro line and taxis be easy to get hold of

thankyou metropark hotel , for a lovely stay in your hotel , this be my forth stay in your hotel over the past   year . your rooms be clean and tidy , the swim pool attendant lady be very contientious with testing the pool regularly and to attend to the guest needs . your front desk be very helpfully and knowledgeable regard hong kong . but my most gratitude must go to eric the deputy manager , who be the perfect host . once again thankyou eric and staff at the metropark for make my stay in your hotel so

hotel look impressive on entry and the location be n't too bad with two mtr stations nearby plus free use of a shuttle bus

stay at metropark kowloon . take the airport express train to hk then the free shuttle direct to the hotel . check in be efficient and we be upgrade to a club room . room be renovate with lcd screen , contemporary decor etc . happy with the upgrade . wall though be a bit thin . we have a connect room and our neighbour be certainly not happy with the din we make at night

i stay here from   aug   ! the location be ok not very touristy but all sign and direction be in english and mcdonalds be a   walk and mtr be   away ! !

i stay here with my brother in september   for   night and we enjoy our stay at the metropark hotel kowloon . for the record we do not stay on the club floor but in a standard room

we stay just as swine flu be gathering pace and all staff be wear masks . at check in we have our temperature take ! one of the sister hotel have be quaranteed

comfort

hotel be as we expected . not the top , but more than adequate for our   day stay

this be my second stay at the metropark kowloon and i highly recommend it . the rooms be not huge but be well lay oot . yes yes i think they be small until i see a friend room at a hotel on the harbour that be twice as much in cost and     smaller ! ! space be expensive in hong kong   get use to it ! ! the hotel be close to transport   bus 's in particular be great and the mtr station isnt that far away . close enough to nathan road to enjoy the site and shopping and far enough away to avoid the noise . the supermarket across the street be a great bonus buy up on soft drink , snack and water as be all the laundry along waterloo road . we could have all of our laundry do for about     who need to take home dirty clothes ? this alone make pack for our second visit super easy as we not take as much   so there be more room for purchase on the way home !

i manage to get a great deal kayak com and this place be great . the subway system in hk be so amazing that the location do n't really matter  even though it 's not in the middle of the action , it 's a   min walk to a good area and then a   min ride to the heart of the action and it 's really cheap , safe , and comfortable transit the hotel also have free transfer to downtown kowloon . the hotel be very clean and the rooftop pool be a total gem

we recently stay at this hotel for   whilst visting bangkok , australia and fiji and the staff here be unbelieveably rude ! we try to book a number of trip as to make the most out of our trip and find them over price and the hotel tour operator rude and abrupt . we request the tours we wish to go on and she tell us they be rubbish and to go on the one that she want us to and the couple in front to go on etc etc . also she would not tell us the method of transport to the tours   dangerous ? you have to pay before she tell you and it be one way so you have to first your own way back to the hotel ! ! also if you buy an octopus card from the train station and top it up you can use it at restaurant and on public transport  loads cheaper then taxi . it make it a safer and cheaper way to carry money as you get the deposit back when you have finish your trip ! ! ! public transpport be safe and easy to follow in this city as its incredibly efficent ! ! ! make it more fun do it on your own , to your own itinerary and choose where to stay the longest each day ! ! the hotel be dead at night , one bar be open but the atmosphere be dull and boring

the staff be very helpful and the complimentary breakfast for the period we be there be an unexpected bonus

plus point  

many review lead me to believe that this hotel be a good option for our short stay in hong kong . we select a standard room and it definetly need refurbish ! there be better option available with location and room quality

stay at this hotel for   nights . location   well away from the main attraction eg the peak , star ferry and harbour . it be quite close to the main market but it be still involve a good walk and in the heat of the night and day it can seem a long way

the first disappointment be the actual location of this hotel . its name suggest it be in the centre of kowloon however it be not and be much further north . do not be mislead by kowloon be in its name . i stay in one of the lower price rooms but be very disappointed . the bathroom be very date and be not very clena . the room itself be small and the decor be extremely dated . despite request a non smoking room it be clear the room have be use by smoker as all furniture and the curtain smell of tobacco smoke . will not be stay here again

the hotel be in central kowloon , the rooms though a little small be well equip and maintain , all area be spotlessly clean

this a be a nice holiday of   days where we where with metropark i have my two kid   and   they too have a good fun . the hotel be setinly not in the middle of the city or near to the mtr but they surly have a free shuttle bus service to near by station mong kok and tim sa tuisi . the hotel be clean and the pool be also nice the kid love

we find the hotel be exceptionally clean and tidy . the room be quite a good size with every amenity have hear that hong kong hotel rooms be small we be pleasantly surprise . great lcd tv too but the usual poor channels

when book this hotel , i didn ` t realise how big hong kong actually be ! the hotel isn ` t locate right in centre of hong kong . to get anywhere you have to walk   minutes to the nearest mtr station , which for us be mong kok . this wasn ` t a problem as we start to enjoy our daily walk see some interesting sights of hong kong along the way . the hotel do have a shuttle bus which drop you off at two location within kowloon and this run every half and hour . the hotel service itself be good . the rooms be a good size and all the staff be helpful . the hotel have a roof top pool which i use when it be rain and also what look like a mini gym . we be book in as room only , but the hotel have its own bakery to stock up on breakfast and snacks . the travel agent locate in the hotel be very helpful and we organise our day trip to china through them . overall a good stay and i would stay there again

the hotel be worth the money spend and the room be also big enough to hongkong standard . the staff be helpful . and not forget to use the shettle bus to mong kok and tim sa

stay in the metropark kowloon , may this year [   ] . the hotel be only a   min walk from lady market , which be a must for bargain hunters . the free shuttle bus to the promenade of star and the ferry area be a big bonus . its reliable and frequent   every   min or so . the food in the hotel be excellent   buffet breakfast , with everything you could wish for . the evening meal be quality food , with an excellent seafood buffet a few times a week for about Â £   per head . the bar be expensive at Â £   a pint for san miguel    but at least there be a happy hour [ actually four hours ] with   for the price of one . the lift be not a problem , reception be good , and the luggage room for late departure be secure . it cost us Â £   to retain the room for a late departure the room itself be on the small side , just big enough for two . everything be clean and modern the only problem we have be nothing to do with the hotel itself . we have problem find a restaurant with menu write in english . now i know that hk be now in china , but because of the british influence over the years , i expect to encounter more bars and restaurant cater to british tourists   well that be not the case in kowloon . this prove a problem . the chinese influence in kowloon be now almost total . every menu in chinese   and not much english speak either . if this could be a problem to you   you will be better off stay nearer to the sea front , at the bottom area of nathan road

we go there because it be very near to the exam center , the price be fair , because it be in a high season , and they upgrade our room into suit . very big and clean , the bed be extremely comfortable . good value !

metropark kowloon be quite an enjoyable stay . it 's in an area that 's less hectic or noisy , yet not too far from the action . rooms be simple , basic and practical . free shuttle service be provide to mongkok near mtr station and tsim sha tsui from which you can walk to star avenue . you can opt for airport shuttle at a price we get both trip complimentary since we stay more than   consecutive night , which take about   hour per way . public bus be available at the doorstep , a supermarket across the street and plenty of food nearby

good value hotel in hong kong , away from the main sights   min walk from mtr station and local markets . small rooms but clean and comfortable . when we extend our stay they give us the rate we have originally pay with an agent rather than the walk i rate

i book this hotel   month before go partly because a friend be stay there and partly for the facilities . the pool and fitness centre be undergo renovation so be unavailable . i would never have go there if i 'd know this . the location be a problem too , even use the free minibus to tsim tsa tsui leave a   minute walk to the star ferry . go out to dinner in hk mean an hour each way minimum

we stay here last march   the location be nice . friendly adn helpful staff    we bodked for a double bed but wen we get there we get a twin bed instead    though we be transfer the next day to another room with double bed    i wasnt sooo crazy about the hotel   its so so   mmm average   but i enjoeyd my stay much coz my hubby and i really need a break   food be nice   i hate the ham and cheese sandwich ! ! ! ! ! but other than that the breakfast buffet be excellent . laods ot choose from and very delicious i destroy my diet !     room be clean   the bath room be ok   the tub be small though hehhehe    but yeha, . staff be friendly and helpful  

stay for a few night with friends . close to market and electronics and sneaker shop about   min walk distance . free shuttle to and from tsim sha tsui   handy if you want to see the nighly light show by the water front . shuttle to and from airport be available at a cost of hk     although this really should be complimentary

i stay   night at metropark hotel kowloon during   there be no problem with my book through agoda com , check in     check out be easy     fast

book this hotel base on the number of good review it get from fellow traveller   it truly do not disappoint , consider the fact that hk hotel be know to scrimp on space

stay for three night and arrive at abour   be expect problem but staff be very good and have the room ready by   which be really helpful . this hotel be really in the middle of what i would call the real hk , not the glass and concete of hong hong island . you will be in the midst of ordinary folk go about their normal business , and not surround by a million other tourists . the hotel be surrouded by what seem hundred of little shop and cafe with english being a rarity our room be good , adequate standard facility which even include a phone in the bathroom ! the view be nothing spectacular as we be on the back of the hotel and overlook local appartments

when we initially arrive there be some confusion regard room allocation .   of our party be give smoking rooms and   couple be give a twin   not the best start ! however , the reception staff sort it out for us and be very helpful . the hotel be clean and comfortable and the buffet seafood restaurant be nice . the swim pool and gym area be close for refurbishment so we could n't use them , but we be offer a very good deal when book to compensate

this be a pleasant enough hotel . my room view towards the back of the hotel , so it be nice and quiet   and once i 'd work out how to turn off the air condition and stop shiver , it be rather a pleasant place

the hotel give us a very good impression with great location   min walk to mongkok mtr , lady market and other busy street in mongkok , clean and spacious

we stay in this hotel a couple years ago now , but we love it so much , i just have to comment on how fantastic this hotel is . beautiful decor , very friendly staff and great service provided . i will be stay here again on our next trip back to hk . this hotel be locate fairly close to the temple st night market and we walk around kowloon easily from our hotel . the sip sip bar be awesome . very friendly staff here , especially a waitress call     agather    . not sure if i spelt her name right , but either way , she 's the best ! . we have alot of help from the friendly concierge , and the lady that works at the tourist desk . in a nutshell   the best quality hotel for a great price . love it

i just visit hong kong for   night during   march   i have read many good review about this hotel before so i decide to stay at metropark kowloon . book through online travel agent , the price be reasonable around   per night for cheapest room without breakfast

excellent value , spacious room , friendly staff , a great hotel for aussie traveller of all ages . staff even prepare a breakfast box on checkout as we have an early flight to london breakfasts be lovely , cater for all taste

  of us travel   first time in hk . stay one week . no problem arrange for adjoining smoking rooms on arrival . reception staff efficient , friendly and helpful . rooms spacious and very clean , we want for nothing and we be not in 'top of the range ' rooms . swim pool unavailable under renovation   hotel advise us prior to our visit and we could have change to another hotel but do n't feel we would be desperate for swim in hk during february . have breakfast most morning   tremendous range of food , beautifully present , no tummy upset and staff superb ! free shuttle bus be brilliant . we really could not fault this hotel and stay here really make for a wonderful hong kong holiday

stay at the metropark for four night , think be be a very good hotel

i recently stay at the metropark kowloon . this be my second stay . the hotel be locate in a more residential area of east mong kok , but be convenient to nathan road , the lady market , and a variety of public transportation that include numerous bus with service to tsim sha tsui , hong kong island and beyond , the star ferry terminal both tsim sha tsui and hang hom , and the hang hom railway station on the east rail line , two mtr stations yau ma tei and and mong kok , and the east rail line east mong kok station * . schedule and location of bus route be post in english and chinese at each of the bus stops . the east rail line go to the mainland border . in the direction of tsim sha tsui the train stop at the hang hom railway station where you can take direct train to guangzhou , shanghai , and beijing

the hotel appearance be very modern and clean , very much like a   hotel . the rooms be great , mid size with very clean and modern bathroom which be a great plus . most hotel have rooms that be clean and modern and the bathroom be usually a bit old . but metropark be fabulous . it be truly a very comfortable stay . the location be good for us as it be about a   walk to all the night market and very good eatery be around the area . it 's a bit of a hustle and bustle outside but we prefer this much more so than in the cbd area . we pay   rates for a   hotel ! swim pool be currently out of service due to renovations . a

we be a group of eight   adult and   kid and i personally pick the place because it 's not a too crowd area for the kids . i book through agoda and i have no problem with regard to my booking . they have a shuttle bus that run every   min to mongkok mtr station and tst . there be many restaurant within the area . lady market be just walk distance from the hotel . or you can catch the shuttle bus in go to mongkok and afterwards walk your way to the hotel   min . hotel staff be very accomodating especially when it come to direction to attraction in hongkong

this be an excellent hotel for the money . very nice room and good service . the breakfast buffet be very good , with plenty of asian and western choices . and for some reason , every morning they would give me a coupon for my breakfast . do n't know if you can expect this or not !

great hotel . great staff . everything very easy to fix and solve . no major dramas . i personally like the breakfeast . a mix of continental and chinese , but i suspect other hotel could be as good . overall i would book another night wihout any

we be initially give a twin room , which be a bit of an annoyance . no apologies which seem to be the attitude of the staff in general . that twin room be nice , quite spacious for a hongkong hotel really . interesting thing be it contain a bath and a universal adapter power board with   empty slot , lan cable for free internet usage

be very impress by this hotel . it be only a short walk from the centre and main street , but far enough away that it make for pleasant stay . do not eat in the hotel , but that be only because there be so many eatery to choose from . great wee supermarket across the road for any basics you want and launderette and chemist also . do not really know what to expect as have never be to china before but would definately go back again , and stay here . only complaint be they web site say the pool would be close for maintenance and it be n't , but it do look nice when we go up for a look

i stay at the metropark on   and   december . the hotel be in a good location about a   minute walk to the mtr station and there be plenty of market within walk distance . i book a non smoking room but be give a smoking room . they do not have a non smoking room until the   night . the difference in the room be incredible . not only the smell ! ! much nicer decoration and ambiance . that be the only reason i give this review a   and not a   bear in mind to be sure you have a non smoking room if your not a smoker of course

we spend   days and   night in hongkong at metropark , kowloon hotel

stay at this hotel for   days . upon check in i be upgrade to a executive room which be superb . you could not fault the room , fully equipped,excellent bathroom , very clean with good housekeeping . breakfast be also very good and the staff helpful . reception have some good map of the city and provide a free return courtesy bus to mongkok and the city centre every   mins . the hotel be about   min walk to the nearest tube station and   min walk to mongkok and nathan road . the best way to the hotel from the airport be get a coach which can be book from the arrival hall at hk airport and they charge   hk dollar and take u to the hotel which can take between   mins . do not take the light railway as it do not take u to mongkok unless u want to change   times and its not any cheaper .   min walk take you to nathan road which be mile and mile of shop and eat place

we just return from our family holiday stay in metropark kowloon from   to   our stay be great and get the best hospitality by the hotel which we book after reading the various review about the hotel in hk through tripadvisor . our get quick checkin at   am . mr . kimmy kwok the reservation mananger     ms . cathy tin help me provide   day more stay , than our book as my daughter get ill in our trip , even they inquire by visit us

excellent hotel . our reservation be upgrade when we tell them we be on our honeymoon so result

a lot of good review about the hotel here . and i agree with most . it be clean , good service and reasonably size for asia . the location be pretty good . the fact that it be a   min walk to the mtr be mitigate by the free shuttle to new world centre at tsim sha tsui . from there you can walk to the ferry for hk , or just check out tst . also note the   bus stop on the same block as the hotel , and take you to hong kong . it be cheaper than the mtr but might take longer during rush hour . also when you be walk along the hk side , check out the bus stop for   , because it take you right to the hotel . sometimes it take a lot of walk to get to the mtr . some of this info be provide by the back of the hotel 's shuttle schedule . read it

i book this hotel base on price and location . at the front desk i be attend by alex , he be good and attend to all of my requests . i be surprise that he upgrade me to the club floor which i later find out only when i get out of the elevator . club floor cost more but i not pay any more than what i book for . thanks alex

we recently do a round the world trip with the   stop be   night in hk . i 'd look at loads of hotel review and as we be look for a reasonable price our trip be   week long so we have to budget ! i think we 'd be in a very basic hotel . we find a deal through travelmood which offer a     hot deal      airport transfer ,   night in the hotel and a half day tour of hk . i 'd read that the club rooms have free snack so ask to upgrade . the total cost in september be Â £   for both of us , inc the upgrade . this give us a beautiful room with free internet access , the free     snacks    from       each evening   which actually consist of a full buffet and drink   and breakfast . it be excellent value . the staff be extremely helpful , the courtesy bus be great , the pool be an add bonus , on the roof . location be great . although we do n't need it there be also a shuttle bus to the airport which be reasonably price ca n't remember exactly how much  we do n't eat out in the evening at all as the buffet be so fill , so we hardly spend a penny over and above our initial outlay , apart from shopping

we recently staayed at the metropark and find it to be excellent in all areas,staff very helpful very user friendly rooms immaculate and food in the restaurantts of a very high order

i travel with my family comprise my wife and   child for   days and   night in hong kong . i decide to book this hotel after do some research on the internet . i book through the hotel website which give a good package for stay   night and above

this be our   stay at the metropark kowloon hotel in   mong kok be a great area to stay in and the hotel be within   minutes of the market and nathan road . shuttle bus take you to the mtr and tst . we have be to hong kong   times in the last   years and have always stay at different hotels . the metropark be the first that we have stay at more than once . already plan our next trip and we will come back to the metropark . the staff be lovely and checkin and checkout only take   both times

book metropark kowloon through expedia and get a club room at     off . the room be really nice . quite spacious for hongkong . the only negative be the bed . it be rock hard ! ! we not ask about change rooms as think all the bed would be the same , however when speak to some other guest they say the bed they have be very comfortable

go by trip advisor , rather than our hong kong bear travel agent , we select the metropark . we be not disappoint ! it be just far enough from the hustle     bustle to give us a break from hong kong 's   pace . with the complimentary hotel shuttle bus to tsimshatsui and mongkok we have convenient access to all of kowloon . both the kowloon canton railway and the mtr underground stations be a five minute walk from the metropark . the mtr wisks you to hong kong island in a matter of minutes . check in be fast     friendly . the elevator always worked . our room be comfortable with a full range of amenities . the buffet breakfast have both western and chinese choices . we do n't use the pool as there be thunder storm and heavy rain almost the whole week we be in hong kong . the hotel be very convenient for access our tours to hong kong island and macau . shopping be just a few minutes away in mongkok or by the mtr underground to other areas . we usually have dinner at a mongkok restaurant . across the street from the hotel be the large hoover restaurant . it serve dim sum until   we usually try to get back there for a late lunch . our travel agent think we should be right in the centre of activity around tsimshatsui . on reflection , we be very happy to be a little bit out of the way in the very comfortable metropark on waterloo street . when we next go to hong kong , we will look forward to stay at the metropark again

use this hotel as my base for a   day stay . very clean and comfortable . all staff encounter be polite and efficient

stay here whilst on a business trip to hong kong and china . during october   stay here years ago and it be all a bit run down . now it really do represent good value for money with many rooms now be refurbished . the rooms be n't large but the n again none be in hk . i actually check out whilst i visit china and the conciege be good enough to look after my large suitcase until i check back in   days later

this hotel be ideal for a break in hong kong

hotel be ok , nothing special

this hotel be perfect if you be have a stop over . its location be good and the hotel have a couple of nice restaurants . they have a good menu to suit all tastes . the rooms be standard and what you would expect but it be clean and have coffee tea facility which be perfect for our overnight stay . we arrive at       and do n't expect them to let us have the room until lunchtime but they give us immediate access which be appreciate after a long flight . the staff be all efficient and you could not fault their service

excellent hotel , not the best location but   min walk to mong kok train station . cant complain about anything about it

stay for   night out and return from oz . for the money Â £   pn it be pretty good . recently refurbish room , smallish maybe v small for american but adequate room well equip and helpful staff , especially the concierge . the buffet breakfast be ample and the main restaurant not bad . as for location , it be obviously not as convenient as those down by the ferry , but be in a residential district which give a one an idea of real hk . the shuttle bus be ok but sometimes full and drop you off   min walk from the ferry . better take the no   bus from the stop bang opposite the hotel for about   penny which go right to the ferry . with taxis so cheap and plentiful , it be not a problem be a little way from the metro markets airport bus etc

i stay for three night here   i splurge and get a club floor room , which would have be just slightly more than a regular room in tst or central

it 's very small , even by hk standards . you can do better . the view be depress

good hotel in kowloon , if you end up on the executive floor , your room and amenities will be much better than the other standard rooms . executive have comfy newly renovate decor . we stay one night in a standard and the room be decorate in the   and have n't be touch since . it be a bit of a walk from the train station ,   mins . nice and close to the     pet market    and the sport good market 

i finish an extensive adventure through mainland china as a single mom traveller with my   year old daughter by stay at this hotel and fly back to canada from hong kong

the place be betten than my expectations    the check in and the check out be really fast    the rooms be clean and big compare to other hotels . we stay in the renew floor and it be very comfortable , there be not in safe in the renew floor but they offer us a safety box downstair . the only bad thing be that it be a bit far away from mtr station , about   minutes walk , but you can always take the taxi , which be cheap and safety . i would definetely recommend it

  adult and a teenger stay aug   book a triple room which have   single bed which be ok for   days any longer and it would have be a bit cramp . we be on   floor which be great for the pool and have a view out onto the main street . the main road be quite noisy but it do not affect my sleep . the pool be fairly small but big enough to have a decent swim in and there be a small gym with run machine and a nintendo wii that be free to use . you can not smoke by the pool which mean you have to get dress and go back to your room if you want a cigarette towel be provide for you . there be plenty of sunloungers and they be never all occupy while we be there . there be pipe music everywhere , in the lift , corridor and by the pool but it be easy to tune it out . breakfast be good with plenty of choice an as it be buffet style you could eat as much as you wanted . the hotel be a good central base , plenty of taxis and airport express bus to train station stop outside . not far from lady market or mogkok east mtr station . small resturant next door tereas serve fab food at cheap price but close at   so we only get there on our last night . plenty to see and do in hk and travel be so cheap and easy . would stay there

we return yesterday from   week stay at the metropark kowloon

free transfer from the airport . it be their promo that time very clean room . free shuttle to mongkok mtr . what more can you ask for

we book our stopover stay to between uk and new zealand   night both ways . i book direct with the hotel which be very straightforward with quick response when organise airport transport and additional kid bed



be book in here by a travel agent after previous stay in the causeway bay branch have be fine . the stay be terrible   internet access be dodgy , i be put in a smoking room despite be a non smoker , the food be average stay way from the omelette and the room shabby . it be a   minute walk from the mtr which be not fun in summer and local restaurant be non existent

this be book by our client for a   business stay in kowloon . the location be nice for us , be more a a neighborhood area but still walkable to mongkok station . there be also free internet in the rooms , which be very nice . the rooftop pool be nice as well , although fairly full of noisy overweight foreign tourist

the hotel be clean and nice . it be far from the mtr but just catch a taxi for a few dollar back . this be important after run around all day . the staff in the restraunt be very nice the breakfast be a good way to start the day . if you stay in this hotel only book the club floor they be much nicer as i have to stay in the other room for one night because they overbooked . everyone in the hotel be polite except the front desk staff but if you do need something ask for joan she be great . overall this be a good stay

we stay   night

although we book through a travel agent , when we arrive we be give the opportunity to upgrade to the exec floor for Â £   for the week

excellent hotel

i book the hotel room in january but when i come to stay in july   they be renovate level   so they give me an upgrade room on level   it be a nicer room

the metropark hotel kowloon be a great hotel for the money . the rooms be large with a full bathroom , dress table , tv and fridge . there be   supermarket near the hotel one be directly across the road and the other be about   minutes walk from the hotel towards mong kok mtr station . these sell a wide range of food include western . we buy fruit and cereal for the   days for the cost of   breakfast in the hotel

we have just return from hong kong     after lots of reading on this sight we settle on this hotel . we book it through our travel agent , but then we e mailed the hotel direct to get an upgrade to the club floor

a large hotel in run down part of city . we find like other reviewer that the room be cold with very firm bed , desk staff unfriendly , restaurant overprice with poor service , and outlook shabby . on plus side   rates be better than many , the pool be great , shuttle bus be very useful , and overall efficiency be good

metropark kowloon be a clean business hotel with friendly staff . we book a club room on the   floor . the package include breakfast and an afternoon drink in the clublounge . we can recommend this for all future travelers . the outside noice be zero and we have quite a nice view . but who care the view , hong kong be a city wait to be explore

i book and stay in an executive room after read the various review post by previous traveller   and quite frankly i be quite satisfy with the room allocated    on the   floor    room be quite large   though the storage be quite

  have free buffet breakfast during our stay   excellent food and variety !  

my friend and i stay here for   night after book through a student base travel agency . for the price we pay , we really wer n't sure wat to expect , and the mix review on the site not help either

just back from metropark kowloon . we have a room on the club floor which mean we have a few extra include in the price

location   a bit of distance to the nearest mtr station , around   minutes walk , in summer it would be too much for me

stay there for two separate   night periods . have book my stay via their own company email month ago . we have no problem with first stay period , however on return from trip to bangkok , find our triple occupancy room have be give away to others by duty manager     eric    , who himself need a refresher course in customer service . feel his atitude be very poor . his overiding aim be to do his job fast but with no consideration for customers . finally allocate a room with   bed and have to wait   minutes for a rollaway bed . this arrive but the mattress be so uncomfortable that it need to be changed . the next rollaway have a blood stain mattress protector which if we have n't complain , they would have lay sheet on and try to pass its stain away . management try to pass over this problem by give us free breakfast , however this be not worth the money . by enlarge the worst food i have see for a long time

we have none of the problem experience elsewhere . the staff be fine   nothing be a problem . on one part of our journey we arrive early in the morning . at other hotel we may well have be tell to push off until the afternoon but here the room be ready after just an hour . the free shuttle bus to the harbour area be very good and regular . the pool on the roof be well worth a visit . the hotel be on a busy main road waterloo road in mid kowloon but we find this to be an advantage , because we find some excellent eatery nearby that obviously be n't visit by many tourists . really friendly people , though . and infinitely cheaper than eat at the hotel . the hotel bar be ok , but expensive , and a bit desperate , with fashion tv play endlessly , and full of bored looking tourist

what a great find ! hong kong hotel be expensive and have small rooms so when we arrive at the metropark kowloon and check into our club room we be pleasantly surprised . the room be large by hong kong standard with a double bed ,   bedside table , desk , fridge , large flat screen tv armchair and there be still enough room for   big suitcase to lie opne on the floor . the room be n't giant but plenty big enough , and i guess you could say that it be massive by hong kong standards . the bathroom be large but with no bath , however , the shower cubicle be more than double size and if you prefer shower as we do then it could be condisered a bonus

we arrive at the hotel after a long journey cape town , jhb and then hong kong so we be pretty exhaust when we check in . upon check in we be tell that our room be not ready but that it would be ready within an hour . we accept that and decide to walk around for that hr to pass the time . we come back to be tell that the room be still not ready . we then tell them that they say it would be ready , and to this they say that they have find a room to give to us . our luggage be take to the room to be find that two very single bed be give to us . i ask the staff member that why have we be give two single bed when we have book a double . he say that this be one of the better rooms . i then take this up with erik mak the manager on duty at the time to be tell that it have not be book as a double . i not want to argue at the time as i not have the paperwork in front of me . i then go to the room and find all the correspondence that prove that a double have be booked . he then say that the hotel be fully booked . i tell him that this hotel have be book long in advance and we should have be tell that this be not available . he also tell me that the communication that he receive via the international agent do not say anything about a double room . i ask him to show me this email to which he did . it definately do not state a double room but the confirmation from thompson travel definately state a double room . i then say that he should have check upon us checking in , whether we want single bed see that we be a couple . we only go away once a year and this to us be like another honeymoon . under no circumstances could two people sleep in that single beds . they be genuinely single bed and nothing more . i receive a letter of apology from the hotel once get back to sa but that do not alter the fact that our holiday be spoil by this arrangement

we be frequent traveler to hong kong and have be there at least   times before . this time we be in hong kong for three night on a stopover

we stay at the metropark for   days at the beginning of april and   days at the end

we stay at the metropark hotel for   night on the way to bali and find this to be a great city hotel in a good location . we be upgrade for some reason to the club floor and our room be small but modern . we only use the room to sleep and it have everything we needed . it be clean with a choice of pillow and have a lovely powerful shower , although in probably the smallest bathroom i have ever see

its difficult  especially for people who be look for a hotel in hong kong . after all the mix view of the metropark it confuses people , as it do for me before i went . be very skeptical before arrive at the metropark becuase of the different opinion and the terrible image of the hotel on many website that just give a totally false impression of this hotel and make it look like faulty tower

my daughter and i holiday in hong kong last february   , we have the most fantastic time . this hotel be locate a bit of walk from nathan road probably   or so but there a lot of little local shop that you can look at on the way to the main shops . you never know you might just pick up a bargain . my daughter have a shoe fettish so everytime we go shopping she buy heaps of shoes and the staff at the hotel would even line them up neatly for her in the morning . mong kok be close by with tonne of mall with hundred of bargain especially for women . reception staff be very curteous and helpful with direction etc perfect hotel if you not want to be near the noise but still close to the action

i be very satisfy with this hotel . the people be professional and courteous , even the bell boy spokesome english . it 's easily reach by no .   bus , which stop right in front of the hotel from tsim sha tsui , star ferry . yau ma tei metro be   min away by walking . hotel shuttle bus take you to mong kok metro stop , which take you all the way across the harbor to central . its near the lady market , jade market and the night market . i receive free south china morning post every morning . the room have a small frig   although it have some drink which you have to pay for if you use them it have some room for drink that you purchase yourself . the hotel be near many eateries  bakeries , noodle shop ,   , mcdonald be five min away on the right . no need to buy their buffet breakfast . my room be on the eight floor . it be clean , spacious and quiet . the bed and the pillow be comfortable . the only thingt that border me be the room be cold , and you be suppose to keep the ac on at all times which i turn off , anyway . if you take the hotel shuffle bus from the airport , be sure to email the hotel first and ask for the price of the trip and take a copy with you    the guy at the airport hotel bus shuffle counter want hkd   one way per passenger . luckily , i have the hotel email that say it 's hkd   ! after i show the email , he give my daughter and i hkd   for two person ! a great hotel   i would stay here again

we stay here between   march and   apri , for the price i pay i be very impress with the room . we have a normal comfort room and it be a reasonable size although the bed be a bit short and my   boyfriend have his foot stick out the end of the end . the shower be one of the best we have have in a hotel . the room be clean and conceirge be very helpful . i reccomend get the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel . wa sno hassle you just go to the stand at the airport and it only cost     each . which for the ease of it be great value . we use the free shuttle bus at least once a day and we always get on . all in all very impress and would definatly stay there again

stay here for   night in january   , and get upgrade to one of the 'club ' floor rooms . room be clean , modernly decorate and well furnished . service in the hotel be good . hotel seem to provide a range of good facilities . all very comfortable

ok so last year i say to myself that i have see all that i need to see in hong kong , so thats why i go there again this year . my   choice of hotel have to be for the forth time , the metropark in kowloon

we stay here for   night as part of our honeymoon in asia . the hotel be book through our travel agent and it be the only   star hotel we book for our holiday   all others be   or   star so i supose my inital reaction be dissapointment but i only have myself to blame and this be in comparison to the other hotel we stay at which would be unfair to compare

a good functional hotel , with decent enough rooms and facility

large hotel with   restaurant , rooftop pool and a fitness room . room be a good size , clean and comfortable . you can change your pillow   type to choose from definitely help improve my sleep . bed be a little on the hard side . room be cold   staff send up a heater promptly when ask and we have to have the heater on all the time to keep the room tempaerature on the warmer side . complimentary tea coffe and water which be replinished everyday

my fiance and i stay at this hotel from       and again on       this be our first trip to hong kong

i stay here for a week while on a business trip . main reason for book this hotel be its close proximity to my office . but , i be really impress with just about everything here    the price , level of service , room comfort , etc . if available , spend a bit extra for a club level room  extra amenities and very quiet floors . the only reason i would not stay here again be just to experience other hotel in hong kong   this be simply a great hotel

stay here for a week , be nice place . very comfy and nice rooms . its location compare to other hotel in hong kong be a bit far away its   min walk to nathan

my husband and i , with our   kid , age   years , and   month , stay for   days over christmas   we stay on the kowoon side to be closer to my husband 's family , but i really enjoy stay away from the tourist traps and be able to get a feel for how people live here

stay at metropark kowloon for just over   weeks . be there with a group of friend and we occupy   rooms

unexpected luxuriously hotel

excellent hotel,could n't ask for anymore  efficent service,rooms clean and decent size

book with hrs com and when i arrive they could not find my reservation . i show them my print confirmation and after   minutes of look through the computer and go to the back office , they say they still say they could do nothing for me . i raise my voice a bit in front of some other guest and finally they give me the room that i reserve

i book the hotel via the hotel 's reservation web page for a double room from jan   ,  

i stay at metropark during christmas   and book it early to get a good price . one thing i do before i book be check thoroughly and research as much as i can about this hotel and i come across tripadvisor . i get my answer here and people give it good review

exceed our expectation of a   star hotel . we get a complimentary room upgrade to spacious type . love the chicken pie at the hotel bakery . convenient for eatery and supermarket wellcome     man opposite the hotel . there be a very nice restaurant only few door away at leave side of hotel serve delicious roast goose and pork , and they be open from   till  

stay at the metropark kowloon for   night between xmas and new year . the room be very clean , though due to our late arrival all the double rooms have be take and we have to have a twin instead . after hearing report that hk hotel rooms be small , be surprise to find the room be about the same size as a typical hotel in the uk . it be a good   minute walk to the nearest mtr stations yau ma tei or mongkok . the hotel shuttle will drop you near the mongkok mtr or near the avenue of the star in tsim sha shui . the pool be small but be never busy . the fitness room be also small , but it do contain a nintendo wii ! hotel bakery be excellent and very cheap . buffet breakfast be also great . staff be more than happy to store our bag for the day due to late depart flight

this hotel be very comfortable and clean . the staff be friendly and very helpful . its location be good , as easy walk distance to mongkok mtr and also nathan road . we not use the pool , so cant comment on that . we stay in kowloon as the hotel be much cheaper than hong kong island , and away from the hustle and bustle , but within walk distance . the hotel have a free shuttle bus that take s you to star ferry terminal , and they run all day until   , so we use this quite a lot

be a good hotel and well price when compare to some others . be not as close to lady 's market or the mtr station as we think , but not excessively far . have be renovate so everything be relatively nice and new . will be stay here again

we end up stay at this hotel due to the fact we book our flight to nz via hk and want to stay at metropark causewaybay only to find out a few week later that it be full,and so be everywhere else in dec as its conference season as afamily of   adult and   child age       we have to have   connect rooms which be expensive only reason i mention this be the hotel will not allow   in a room however on our way back the hotel again be fulland we could not have connect room so they put single bed in room for my kids . hotel be about   min from airport in a red taxi cost about   be ok have stay at worse . pay a little extra for club i think it be worth it only real gripe be the air con which be freezing can turn it off in room at switch but it make no diff as i get houskeeping in the end to assist but the main hotel aircon still come into the room staff be helpful and friendly and the little bus to the market and harbour be useful taxis be cheap

locate along waterloo road , mongkok , this hotel be a little off the beaten track but still only a short   minute walk to the nearest mtr mongkok station . also the kcr railway station be close by so be ideal for anyone planning trip to new territory or shenzhen , china

the hotel be locate at mongkok which be near to lady market , goldfish market , flower market , temple street , etc . it 's in the centre of shopping area and many good local food

i choose the hotel by price . it be in a reasonable area of uptown kowloon with prince edward mrt station a few minutes walk away as well as numerous bus services . check in always seem to be busy but the staff be friendly . i have ask for a room as high as possible and get the sixth floor of thirteen . the room seem to have everything you expect , with courtesy soap , shampoo , foam bath , toothbrush and toothpaste . it have the inevitable over price minibar fridge but there be a   convenience store across the road

stay at the metropark as asingle traveller for   weeks . locate outside the main tourist area but with all main attrations within easy reach by bus,minibus,taxi mtr train or kcr train t ip buy an octopus card at any mtr station,this give you cheap travel on most public transport and save use small change

this hotel be great

first time in hk , a little worry about location vi a vi public transport . naturally , the last day in town we discover that the closer mongkok east station link to the mtr at tsim sha tsui east   much shorter walk . the free   bus in front of the hotel make run to the kowloon station for the airport express every   minutes

we spend   night at the metropark kowloon with our   teenager and find the accomodation quite adequate . consider how little we pay approx     per room per night we certainly cant complain . the rooms be a little tired but still great value . we email the hotel the day before we be due to arrive to confirm our book and request for adjoin rooms with a roller away and everything be in order when we arrived . not use the shuttle bus much but use the no   bus across the road as it take us directly to the star ferry

stay for   night from november   ,   hotel shuttle bus van run every   minutes to fa yuen street in mong kok shoes and electronics shop and new world centre which be walk distance to harbour view at tsim sha tsui . walk to nearest mtr mong kok be not so bed either , only about   minutes walk . the ac be quite cold , but i guess i 'd like it better during summer month in hk . room be basically clean with daily service with clean towels . rooftop swim pool and gym with a few workout machine

fly from wales to hong kong direct and stay in this hotel for one week , clean rooms , good friendly staff , the bar stay open until   and have a big screen tv that some how only play fashion tv . but there be a great bar just around the corner from the hotel and that have live music and open until  

we be concern about find a hotel in hong kong   would it meet western standard , be it accessible , how 's the service personnel , etc ? ? ? we be so pleasantly surprise

plus

stay at the metropark for   nights . efficient check in and get twin non smoking room as requested . the only down side that the air con in the room could not be switch off and myself and friend find we be too cold . housekeep bring us blanket and a heater which we have to use on get up in a morning . someone else may be glad of a cold room and probably in the hot humid season we would have be too . otherwise the room be clean , of average size with decent bathroom and maid service daily . there be a light that show outside the door to either request make up the room or do not disturb which be handy as with door hanger they either fall or somone remove it . staff overall be friendly . location of hotel be fine . some of the earlier review comment that it be too far out but they obviously do n't like walk ! we do n't use the hotel free shuttle as it be only a   min walk to an mtr station . walk be the best way to see a city and we get to know several different ways back to the hotel . to get to this hotel from the airport get the airport express to kowloon station and then go to the free transfer bus that run every   min

i stay   night at the metropark hotel on waterloo rd from october   i book an executive suite as the hotel website say that they be be renovate

just return from   days at this great hotel . book their executive package directly with the hotel which include free breakfast , free drink in the executive lounge each day for two hours ! ! plus many other extra   well worth the money . bus opposite the hotel take you directly to the star ferry or you have a   minute walk to the metro station or the lady market for shopping ! very friendly staff and hotel room be great . will definitely be go back again in another  

we stay at the metropark kowloon for   night in july â     as part of our trip around the world , and choose this hotel as our base to explore hong kong

the hotel be a bit old but ok . as mention in other post , it be a bit far from things . you can take bus     to the star ferry terminal   ask the concierge . there be not many restaurant nearby but we count three bakery , which we take full advantage of

at first i be not happy with this hotel because it seem to be far from everything , but to nathan road be approx .   min . walk , and   min to lady market , the hotel have own shuttle to lady market and star ferry , so it be ok . so you will be not force to walk if you do n't like it   room be big , bigger than in other hotel in hk   swim pool and fitness room be on the roof   nice view ! breakfast be copious , you have european and asian dish   joghurts , fruit , cheese ! ! ! , rise , noodle , sausage , bred etc etc etc   everything you need

stay twice at this hotel . first time the room be more recently renovated . twin beds . mattress quite hard . flatscreen tv on wall emit a bright blue light on its control panel which make it hard to sleep at night as the whole room seem illuminated . couldnt switch it off

good place to stay if you need a central location . room comfortable . good free shuttle bus that take you to the two major shopping places . we stay here to break up our journey to sydney . staff friendly . nice bar attach to the hotel

travel to hk with my husband then fiance i be from hong kong and stay there for   days . not recommend at all . the hotel be     far    from mtr subway and all sites . far =  gt   have to walk for more than   minutes be consider far in hong kong there be no bus , nor minivan that go to the mtr station either . hotel do provide shuttle but we never take it  since they run at a certain schedule . hotel room itself be more like a     motel    . pay around   for   night . there be alot more far better and more convienent choice in hk . will not go back though they have now change to     metropark      even if they upgrade all the rooms to   quality , the location be not go to change

this hotel be reasonably priced . excellent service from everyone on the staff . both front desk and concierge be very helpful . i find the free wifi in the lobby and high speed internet in the room very convenient since i bring my own laptop . i be able to charge all my gadget everyday , thanks to the international power outlets . there be quite a few restaurant around the block . the one on victory road have good hainanese chicken . the room be spacious by hk standard , clean but beaten down . do not look as good as what 's in the photo and definitely need some renovation . the location be more residential than tourist . quite far away from subway station , at least   minutes of power walk . the free hotel shuttle to mongkok and tsim sha tsui compensate some . i 'll stay there again

we stay in the metropark for   night in may book through our travel agent . our first problem be on arrival  we have fly in from new zealandso be very jetlagged and arrive to be tell we would have to wait for our room and not only that that the double plus cot we have book be now go to be   singles ! when we come back later to get the key the receptionist say he have manage to get us a double room but we would have to do without a cot as they be all book out  he do n't seem to care that we have pre booked just look at me blankly . despite go back the next morning we be tell there be still no cot available so for the   night our   month old have to sleep in with us  have she be any younger this simply would have be unsafe . there be a few other young child stay in the hotel but this be something they need to plan for , especially as i imagine most people stay there have pre booked . otherwise the hotel be ok , food be a bit bland but ok for feed kid but shuttle bus into kowloon be good  service be ok , but do n't expect any help if you be struggle with a pushchair  luggage etc

metro park hotel be excellent , we really enjoy our stay at this hotel , it be clean ,the staff be polite . we have an executive room on the   floor which entitle us to a quick check in and check out,breakfast , plus the happy hour , believe me pay the extra , it 's well worth it the view from our room be not so good , but i do n't go to stand and look out of the hotel window  we take the free shuttle bus down to the ferry terminal and a ferry across to hong kong island,then onto the bus for a ride up the peak . this be a ride with a difference and a view to match . there be a good few restaurant and shop , we have lunch at the peak cafe look out over the bay . the train ride back down be not to be missed also the one thing you just have to do be afternoon tea at the penninsula hotel , expensive , yes , worth it , of couse . there be lots of different market and a night market not far from the hotel we would recommend the metro park hotel on the basis of excellent value,good service and

this hotel be not our first choice but our preferred hotel be fully booked . so my partner and i stay at this hotel for   night , from august   to   if not for their business development manager , anita , we wouldn â   t have be able to stay   consecutive night â   and at a really great rate too ! we only confirm our hong kong trip a day or   before check in â   during the busy hk food expo . we be one of the exhibitors . last minute decision

we have just return from a week stay in hong kong . we stay in metropark kowloon , a great hotel with easy excess to hong kong major shopping centres . the hotel also provide shuttle bus to the major shopping area in kowloon . metropark kowloon be locate slightly off the busy area in mong kok but you can easily walk back to the hotel . it take about   min to walk from the mrt station back to the hotel . we do n't have much trouble as the map provide by the hotel be easy to follow

decently price hotel , but the rooms be old and not well kept . you feel that you be in a hotel which have not be service for some time . although a little far from metro , they provide a shuttle every half hour . overall i would suggest be that if you not have any other hotel near the harbour , you can stay here . the benefit of stay in the hotel be that it have easy access to the nearby market

this hotel be very inexpensive and to be honest i do not expect it to be anything great when i book it through my travel agent it be everything you could ask for and more it be central to everything and the room be absolutely perfect and spotless all the staff be very friendly and they could not do enough for you very friendly very kind always with a lovely smile and nothing be ever a bother they all make my stay in hong kong a very memorable time and if hopefully in the future i return to this lovely country i will definately be stay at the metropark in kowloon i have rate this hotel as excellent and it be truely well deserved thankyou very very much all at the metropark  mrs e riley     my   year old nephew sam

look up hongkong hotel on a website for last minute booking and the metropark be listed . look up review and description in tripadvisor . it have good review so book with the cheapest link that give you a price and the price be just what i be look for

everything you need from a hotel and

on arrival at the airport we wait for the hotel link bus which be great , my only gripe be that we be the last drop off so after numerous hotel drop and over     later we arrive after a   hour flight it be even more exhaust

cant recommend it enough . the rooms be excellent the staff couldnt do enough for you really clean and friendly service

we stay three night at metropark hotel kowloon on waterloo road in hong kong in may as the last stop of our   days china and hong kong tour from alberta , canada . we love this hotel for the location , which be very close to many excellent shopping area in mongkok district . we pay     canadian per room , which be a good bargain . the hotel have free transportation to the mongkok subway station and the famous tsimshatsui waterfront . hong kong have a very efficient subway system that take you everywhere you want to go . the hotel airport shuttle bus be only hk     per person , which be less than     canadian . the hotel have a good chinese bakery on the ground floor , a good place to buy chinese buns for breakfast . the hong kong bank be right beside the hotel . the hotel room be small , which be typical of hotel facility in hong kong . this hotel have meet our travel expectation   clean room , clean bathroom , hot shower , and work air conditioning . if you be look for good seafood meal in hong kong , visit leu yue mun , a former fishing village on the east side of kowloon . take the mtr subway to yau tong station , walk into the village , buy fresh seafood from the fish market , and have sea king garden restaurant on    cook it fresh for you . if you be look for very good local cantonese food , visit the tiny lin     chuen kitchen ,    , shau kei wan , a famous street for small family own restaurants . take the subway to shau kei wan station and main street east be close by the station . right beside lin     chuen kitchen on    be a famous restaurant for fish ball and noodle frequent by hong kong tv stars . across lin     chuen kitchen be okonomi , a very good sushi place . hong kong be a very clean , safe , and beautiful city with many attractions . the peak tram up to victoria hill multi level shop , restaurant , and observation deck overlook the city and the harbour be a must see , especially at night

we get a fantastic rate on this hotel and be a little bit aprehensive , but there be no need . the room be quite large and no more date than other hotel we have stay in . it be clean and have everything we need , the staff be friendly and helpful all the time

the metropark kowloon be well place for mtr and lady market . the hotel be spotless and the staff friendly and helpful

really enjoy our stay in the metropark hotel . a bit grubby in place but you can not fault the cleaness of the rooms . we have breakfast each morning which i must say cater for all taste . get in early tho as they serve till   be but most things will have go by   the free bus to the ymca near the star ferry run every   hour . which we find useful although taxi 's be extremley cheap in the hotel lobby there be a travel office which can sort out many trip around hong kong . they be very informative iris who serve us be really professional in her job even call us in our room   min before our bus be to arrive . if your first time in the area take advantage of these tours , believe me its the best way to see hong kong and the other islands all in all a good and inexpensive hotel if i be to visit hong kong , i would without question stay here again

how the get there   from airport , one can travel by train bus taxi . personally i decide to ride the hotel one shuttle bus which run every   hour , at reasonable cost

a nice place , and relatively inexpensive , consider how expensive hong kong is . good location , a nice walk to the sights and train station . a little disappoint that the pool be n't open at this time of year , and the restaurant be n't great . but all in all a pleasant enough place for a stopover

after reading lots of review on different hotel in hong kong , we finally take a chance on this one . it be our first time in hong kong , so it be difficult know exactly where we want to be . we want a reasonably price hotel for our   night stay , from   , with decent size rooms , reasonably close to all area of interest

just return from a trip to new zealand with a stop over in kowloon hong kong

extremely please with this hotel ! the rates be very reasonable , and the staff be fantastic ! they really go out of their way to make your stay more comfortable and to make sure you have everything you need ! the roof top pool and fitness room be wonderful ! the staff oversee this area where such a pleasure ! i wish we could have stay longer just to hang out with them ! the free shuttle services to downtown hong kong as well as the night market be always on time and such a convenience ! the front desk staff be always helpful no matter what you need them to do for you ! if i make it back to hong kong , i would n't stay anywhere else ! extremely please !

i stay in the executive rooms at this hotel for five night in april   , i normally stay in standard rooms but manage to get a good rate which mean for     of the price of other hotel i get a lot of extra stuff executive lounge , free drink     snack at dinner internet access

just return from a   day stay at the metropark kowloon . overall a good experience and quite reasonable in a high cost destination

i stay at the metropark for three night in april . i choose the hotel base on room rate and review , and to say it upfront

stay at the metropark kowloon for   night and enjoy every

i be very impress the metropark hotel have serve their guests . in the beginning we get lose as we go to the wrong metropark hotel address mongkok , suppose to be in kowloon , but they be so accomodating that i not worry about transfer

i have stay in hong kong on numerous occasions , and this be about the   hotel i have stay in . i take advantage of a good deal on a week long

this hotel be about a ten minute walk from mong kok subway station in northern kowloon and about   minutes walk from the main night market at temple street . the local area be fantastic , especially at night as some of the little roads cram with shop be pedestrianised and it 's easy to wander around . it 's also near some of the best day market

spend   night here . hotel a little older than most , more than make up for by the excellent service of the hotel staff . swim pool

i be lucky to find this place on my first visit to hong kong last year . i pay about         rate + taxes srvc fee . on my airplane ride to hk i sit next to this older gentleman who tell me that rooms and hotel in hk be small and pretty pricey . so , when i come across mk hotel i feel really fortunate because my room seem pretty big to me and the price be fair in comparison to the other hotel that i researched . the room be clean and neat , nice decor , tidy bathroom   there be a pool on the roof and i even get to use their tiny   fit max .   people gym a few machine and a treadmill or two . overall service be friendly and helpful . they also have a free shuttle to the airport and to tsim sha tsui at different times . the hotel be locate pretty close maybe   min walk to the lady market so it 's convenient to do shopping and explore throughout mong kok . my only beef be that there be suppose to be free internet access in the bar downstairs , except that it be n't free because you have to purchase something to sit in there . overall , metropark kowloon be a nice place to stay if you can get a good deal on room rates

i book this hotel as hotel in tst be fully book due to the conventions . as i have never hear of this hotel before , i be rather skeptical

i be very please with my stay at the metropark hotel . even though it be the first day of chinese new year , the transfer to the hotel and check in be quick and efficient . the room be comfortable and extremely clean . i read in a previous post that the bed be hard , and be concern about this . while firm , it be not too firm . i sleep better than in my own bed . they even offer you a choice of pillows . room service and the cleaning staff be excellent , and the hotel restaurant be also first rate . while i rarely take tours , i be press for time , and take advantage of the hotel 's tour office . the two tours i take be great . the tour to china also include a chinese visa , which make the trip a bargain . while some may feel the location be a bit out of the way , they do have a shuttle service . i never bother with this , as the metro stop be just a short ten minute stroll away . the location around the hotel be also a sight . while waterloo sreet be a quiet oasis for hong kong , at least , the lady 's market be nearby . argle street be a sea of people and make time 's square look tame

stay here for   night prior to leave for oz . there be   adult and a   yr old in our group

we stay here for   night in mid january as a stoppover trip to china

stay at this hotel for a week and apart from the location , which be a bit disappointing , i have no real complaint about the hotel . upon arrival the staff be very helpful and take care of our luggage whilst we go to check in , at which we be quickly dealt with . the double room we stay in be clean and the size be comfortable . we visit the hotel 's two restaurants . the food in the restaurant be excellent and vary and be worth trying . the sip sip bar which have a sporty theme offer a good variety of cocktail and provide an opportunity to catch up with premiership football matches . one tip i would suggest be that if you ever get a taxi back to the hotel make sure you tell the driver that you want to go to the metropark hotel kowloon , as there be another metropark hotel nearby

this hotel be call the metropole and still bear the name on parts of the hotel and stationary guides etc . it be not luxurious but comfortable , and in hong kong you do n't hang around your hotel , you shop or you tour or you be in transit . they be locate in amongst the     dirty    part of kowloon call mongkok , but give that you could walk to the lady and temple st market so if you be happy to be amongst the local it can be interesting . they have a free shuttle that leave every   minutes to the mongkok market and down to the star ferry so this be handy , but be often full so have to get in early

after stay at the metropark hotel kowloon hong kong we feel we have just have a great value january break

we stay at this hotel for two night on our return from oz . after read some of the bad review before we go , we be pleasantly surprise with the metropark , it be we feel worth the   star , and rate much better than some english   we have stay in . we have a standard double room and find it to be a very comfortable size , a queen size bed and a couple of easy chair , tea coffee make facility and a mini bar , which be useful for hold juice and milk not to mention beer a nice bathroom . overall the hotel be spotless and the staff helpful and friendly . the buffet breakfast we find excellent value with plenty of choice for all for around Â £   per person . the shuttle bus be a convenient way to get to tst and even the walk to mongkok be n't that far . we have transfer arrange and both ways be easy , uncomplicated and prompt . only one complaint the air condition in the dine room be too cold , on our last night we have dinner in our coats . apart from that top marks we would n't hesitate to recommend it

i stay at the metropark on transit to oz   i spend two night at the hotel . i stay in an 'executive room ' , the only thing i would say be that i would hate to see a standard room . it wasnt very spacious

my family of   recently stay at metropark kowloon from   dec   at first we be happy with the staff , accomodation be decent and the shuttle bus be convenient . however , on the final day my parent go shopping on the morning before checkout and get lose come back . they be   minutes late for the shuttle bus to the hotel and amidst their distress from get lose and worry about be late to the airport , the staff member who be responsible for check their room upon checkout verbally abuse them to the point of my mum be in tears . he tell my father they have to catch a taxi to the airport and that the hotel will not refund the money they have already pay for the shuttle bus back to the airport . as the shuttle bus be await my family to board to take them to the airport , instead of allow my parent to quickly board , this staff member decide to continuously abuse them and make the people on the bus continue to wait . the language this staff member use be unacceptable and my entire family leave with a sour taste for this hotel . it be unfortunate as they enjoy most things about this hotel . additionally , when an email be send to this hotel of this complaint , they fail to address it and have choose to ignore it . they say that they have a customer focus policy , but obviously they not

we stay here for   night early december and enjoy our stay . we arrive early about   and check in at executive club and they let us in the room then which be wonderful as we need the sleep as come from london

firstly all review be subjective and we all have different expectations . we travel to hong kong in november with our   year old , just to break up the flight to australia . we book an executive room and airport transfer via the hotel web site all very easy . we choose the hotel have firstly raid the travel agent brochure and then via various reviews . the hotel suit both our budget and location for the   night we stayed . it be close to the tourist area contain lady market goldfish street bird garden etc . the hotel run a very regular free transfer minibus here and then onto the star ferry terminal and back . the hotel be a little date but the rooms be well present and keep spotless . the linen be always fresh and clean . the bed be nice and firm , something our daughter insist on , easier to bounce on ! ! the staff be always attentive and have a smile on their faces . the breakfast buffet be well present offering a little for all tastes . we feel at the end of the stay that we have make a good choice give the number of hotel around

we stay at the metropark kowloon for   night in november , and find it to be a very nice hotel . we stay in a non smoking room , which be very comfortable and clean

this hotel be not only very poorly locate one have to wait for the hourly shuttle to take you anywhere   nothing be in walk distance , but it be also very very old . everything be outdated , the carpet be musty , paint peel on the wall , the bathroom counter top be chipped . the bar downstair be pack with clutter see the picture i take in the bar   how can you relax with the place look like this ? ! . all in all the hotel be unkempt , dirty looking and yucky smelling . whoever come up with the interior decorate must have be on crack   it be uglier than ugly . if you do n't care about hotel cleanliness or good service , but just after a good price , then this place be for you . if you be traveler look for more classy digs , go somewhere else   you can find a much better hotel for the same price in hong kong . and in a better location

i stay at the metropark kowloon for several days . it appear to be a nice , clean hotel . however , by about the   day , i start notice that i have some small red bump on my torso . the next day , several more appeared . the day after i leave the hotel , the bump develop into welt all over my arms , waist , shoulder and legs    about   in total . after do some research , i realize these be bed bug bites . sometimes it can take up to   days for these bite to appear , so i be probably be bitten a little every night without know it . if you stay at this hotel , be very careful . check the bed sheet , blanket and mattress to make sure your room be not infest with bed bugs . you also have to make sure they do n't get onto your luggage or chothes or you could end up infest your home with them

i stay at the metropark kowloon for a few night recently

room be very good for the money . pay     us dollar a night , so search for a bargain at the different hotel site because they all have a different rate for the same hotel . i think the breakfast buffet be disgust pretty much and overpriced . the hotel be locate about   min walk to the mtr station . i would likely stay there again for that price

we have now stay at the metropark hotel kowloon , formerly the metropole   times increase our length of stay each time , until we have now just return from a   night stay

we stay at the metropark kowloon for   night and thoroughly enjoy ourselves .   sept to   sept

i stay here for   from the   of september

i check into the hotel on   sept and check yesterday . the whole stay in the hotel be smooth . the hospitable services provide by the hotel make me feel so much at home . i be always greet by the room service lady when i first step out of my room every morning with     zou san     good morning and a warm smile .

stay at the metropark hotel in kowloon for   night and have no problems . i have read some bad review on this site about it but can not understand why . the staff be very helpful , the room non smoking executive be very clean . the pool be large and the in house food be good . the only negative 's i could point out be that the gym be very small and the location a bit inconvienent not close to any mtr stations but for the money you pay , you cant expect too much . the hotel offer a free shuttle but for me , it not help that much as the drop off location be limited to   stop only . if you want to be in the heart of the city   this be not the hotel to stay in . its in a quiet area but good for family as its close to a supermarket and hospital

unlike the previous reviewer i can understand why some people give this hotel a bad review . however i can also understand why some people would think it 's not all that terrible . i think it all depend on the timing of your visit and therefore the amount you pay for your room . for my part , i unfortunately schedule my trip to hong kong during a big convention and therefore hotel price be increase to quite ludicrous amounts . i can â   t say this be the fault of the hotel as every other hotel i try to book at this time be either more expensive or fully booked . give this situation , i be force to pay probably twice the amount i would have ordinarily pay for the same room have i have the foresight to travel either   week earlier or later

just stay   night in metropark and would not agree with any negative comment i read on this forum . everything be exactly as promise the room be airy clean comfortable and well service the tv work the programme be poor but i do not come to hk to see tv the breakfast be excellent and on special well worth the money . the shuttle bus be very handy and always on time . the staff be friendly helpful and very polite . the swim and gym area be good and well serve , it be a   minute walk to mon kokl mtr if you do not wait for the shuttle bus but what do that matter at the price pay for such an excellent standard of hotel this walk be ok by me . help to wwear off the excellent food my flight be at midnight but i keep the room until   they store my luggage and give me towel and all requirement in the swim pool shower for me to change at the last moment before take the china travel shuttle bus to the airport   arrange via the hotel and very reasonable . speak with swimmer in the sun   one couple be on their   trip   they stay each year for one month   this say it all

just return from one night stop over in hong kong . this hotel be dirty , very smelly . the smell in the room be almost unbearable . staff be not helpful . shuttle bus be not point out to us . tourist sightsee reservation lady have attitude . would never stay again

we stay at this hotel for two week during our first visit to hong kong . as a family of   we have two rooms both of which be very clean and have all the amenities need

do n't ever go to this hotel , it be a complete and utter rip off

where do you start

good value , good location , all that 's be write by others be true . what do make it different for me be as follow

modest price , nice restaurant , a very good bar . the hotel have a regular free bus service to the most interesting parts of the city . the service be excellent . free safe in the room . nice , but little swim pool at the top of the building , with a view . good bussines longue . bus service to the airport at reasonable price   hkd . trip advisor in the hotel . recommend

my husband and i stay at the metropole , hk from   may until   june and we could n't find fault with this hotel at all . our room on the   floor be extremely clean and very comfortable . please do not be put off by what you read as it be all about personal taste . the hotel be in a v good location and mongkok be only a   min walk to the market and shop and metro station . the free courtesy bus provide a link to mongkok and tsim shat sui which be handy for the star ferry terminal and for some shopping at the bottom of nathan rd . please try teresa 's coffee restaurant next to the hotel as they be very friendly and the food be good and very cheap . buy an octopus card from mongkok train station it cost     but be extremely good value as you can use it on the metro , some shop accept it as well as some fast food outlet such as mcd 's . you also get cheaper fare on the metro and it contain a refundable deposit of     albeit there a small handling fee which they deduct save the hassle of have change . you can top it up at any metro station . a brilliant holiday in a fab city      we hope to return again in the near

my wife and i stay at the metropole from   may to   june and have a great time there

we have a very pleasant stay at the metropole hotel in kowloon from   may to the   june   after read other review about this hotel we take the advice give and upgrade to an excecutive room , hich be very worthwhile . a very good breakfast be include in the upgrade price of Â £   per room per night , also   bottle of water each day be leave in the room . it allow a quicker check in and out as there be a separate excecutive lounge . all the staff be extremely helpful and friendly . the only fault we could find be that the bed be a little too firm for my like and the coffee and creamer leave in the room each day to use with the supply kettle , be of very cheap quality and be awful . i would advise anyone to take their own coffee with them . all in all we find this to be a good   star hotel and good value for money

we stay at the hotel in   spell of   night each at the end of may and in all honesty the hotel need a complete refurbishment . we stay in a non smoking executive room on the   floor and find the room to be in need of a complete overhaul . the wallpaper be old and peel in place , the carpet look old with a number of stain , again the bathroom really need update and the shower have terrible water pressure . the room be not executive standard

good point

we stay here   night in the executive non smoking room   floor . we be very surprise by size of the room which we be expect to be smaller . there be no need to stay in the executive deluxe room   the executive room be about the same and cheaper . the rooms be totally smoke free . if you stay in the executive rooms you do n't need to check in at the   floor registration but can go directly to the   floor for priority check in . the include buffet breakfast be available on the   floor executive lounge or in the restaurant . it be adequate   not the best but not the worst either . the rooms be very quiet . the location be more convenient than we have anticipated . the train   mtr be a   minute walk away , or you can take the free hotel shuttle

find this hotel to be excellent in terms of service , cleanliness and room standard . main problem be with location and that be resolve , to a certain extent , by the hotel lay on a shuttle bus to tsim tsa shui and back at regular interval

have stay here   times now . it beats the other         star hotel in the area

the hotel service be quite good , room be very clean . the location be in middle of mong kok   great if you know hong kong very well , otherwise i advice you to stay near tst area

ok , so the title to this review probably lead you to believe i do n't like this hotel . well , you 'd be right but i 'd like to start off by say that the metropole or metrosars , as it be affectionately know be n't too bad and it be pretty cheap   you get what you pay for after all . my wife and i stay here for   night on the third and final leg of our honeymoon . when we arrive we have to wait   minutes to check in because of the queues . when we get to our room we find it be a twin room naturally we have book a double and it absolutely stank of smoke we 'd book a non smoking room . the unhelpful staff at reception only change their attitude when i become very angry and we be eventually give another room which do meet our specifications . i could now tell you a long story about our incredibly rude bell boy , but suffice to say that he be not very nice . at all . on a brighter note , our new room be ok . a little dark and a little small but adequate . it be n't until night time that we find out that the metropole really skimp when buy the pillow   they be fill with sawdust maybe not but it seem that way and be highly unpleasant . so bad in fact , that we actually go out and buy our own ! we do n't eat at the hotel as it be expensive and we do n't hold out hope that it would be any good consider how we 'd find the rest of the hotel . and don â   t bank on use the pool as it â   s only open for around half the year . the location be ok   good for shopping with many street market nearby run until late at night . you may have hear that the sars outbreak start here . well , it 's true and in fact they manage to trace the outbreak to the lift area on the   floor . i for one could n't have think of a more appropriate place ! overall , do not stay at this hotel unless it be very , very cheap

stay in this hotel just before christmas . we upgrade to a room on the executive floor of the hotel , which give us a fairly spacious room which be of a reasonable standard , but in fairness for the price we pay we be more than happy with what we had . the room price also have breakfast include which be very nice . the shuttle bus run from the hotel regularly , and the hotel bar on the ground floor be ok for a relax drink . the service be good and the staff be friendly . cab around the city be cheap which make the hotel location easily accessible to the main site of the city

when i first hear this be the hotel where sars virus first break out i be pretty worry and think about change out hotel   but it be actually ok . the rooms be decent and clean , there be also a safety deposit box in the room

we 'd read mix review on this hotel and that it be     out of the way    . upon arrival we be pleasanly surprise that the hotel be very pleasant in a so so area . the rooms be perfectly fine and clean . the bar and it 's limited menu be expensive   in fact eat be a problem in hong kong full stop ! the hotel also have a roof garden with a freeze pool , and a small gym

we stay at the metropole for three night from   november . our 'superior ' rooms basic but very clean . great shower . minibar price abit high so would buy our essential across the road at the wellcome store . the metropole be very convenient for shopping in argyle street . some great store to be find here . quick access also to the lady market . frequent the bakery   nice pastry ! housekeep staff very friendly and obliging . only use complimentary shuttle once but very handy and punctual . our room have a safe in it but friend 's next door do n't . because of have so many heavy bag , we opt to use their airport shuttle bus . very luxurious indeed . cost be hk     good value . would definitely stay here again

stay nov   for four night in an 'executive ' room which i think be well worth the small difference in cost
