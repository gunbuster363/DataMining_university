nice view . very clean . within walk distance to many sites . but other than that , the room be small , the bed be hard as a rock and they not have many ammenities . if you be look for a nice view for a good price and you walk so much every day that you be to exhaust to notice the hard bed or you wo n't be spending a lot of time in your room , then it be a good choice
