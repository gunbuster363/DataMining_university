we stayed at the Oriental Lander Hotel for 3 nights during our recent HK vacation. Located about 5 minutes by foot from the Prince Edward MTR Station , the hotel was tricky to find at first. However , after familiarise ourselves with the local neighbourhood , it was a breeze for the rest of our stay .
