locate in the centre of things and next door to the 'peninsular ' , one of the best hotel in the world , the ymca salisbury hotel , do n't look very impressive , however , look can be deceive

i enjoy my stay at the salisbury ymca . grant it could do with an update but it be fine for me . you only use your room to sleep in so it serve the purpose . it be clean and comfortable
