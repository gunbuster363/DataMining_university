we stayed at the Grand Plaza with some trepidation , seems like things we read were not great. But we were quite surprised , while it is indeed modern , it was extremely convenient , and nice and quiet. We were all there for a family reunion , so we needed different kinds of rooms- the suites were great for larger families , and meeting up. While there were fewer hotel amenties , they did have free Internet which is GREAT . THey are very near a large grocery and department store , as well as connected to a large shopping mall , which had surprisingly good restaurants. The hotel is very clean , and the staff are very helpful. Also connected to the MTR , which is the cleanest subway system we had ever seen , and we have seen a lot .
