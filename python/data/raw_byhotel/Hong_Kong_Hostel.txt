you pay for what you get i guess   the rooms be tiny , the ac be too strong and uncontrolable , and the bed be so hard and you could feel evry spring . awful ! worst bed on this planet . the only positive be the great location in causway bay

the rooms be small , but it be a hostel , not hotel . you can have private bathroom , so basically it be like a hotel , only tiny rooms

the room i stay in be small and dirty . its locate on the edge of a big shopping area but a couple subway stop away from the main shopping and tourist area . the staff be incredibly rude and unhelpful . most of the staff be not able to speak english and if they can it be very limited . this be strange because most of the other people i encounter in hong kong speak english very well
