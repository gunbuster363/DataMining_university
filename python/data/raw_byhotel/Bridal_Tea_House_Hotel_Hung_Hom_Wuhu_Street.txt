very good value for money . the hotel be slightly far from the main tourist attraction but in a very nice neighbourhood with restaurant , shop and anything you might need . the rooms be of decent size for hong kong and full of light plus they offer a good range of complimentary bath product and drink that make the stay pleasant and provide a service above the price you be paying . staff be also quite helpful
