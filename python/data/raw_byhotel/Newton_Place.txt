i have be to hk a couple of times already , and i will totally not recommend this hotel especially if you 're travel with child or older people due to it 's location unless of course if your purpose of travel be just within the area , then u ought to be in this hotel . the hotel 's location be too far from almost everything ! even the nearest mtr station that be the only reasonable thing that could get u around the whole of hk would require a lot of your energy to get there . would be nice to do the walk of course , good for everyone 's health , but when you 're on a strict schedule , especially tourist , who would n't wan na miss a second of their time , this be not the place for you

have be to hk several times already , we make it a point to stay in the area of tsim sha tsui , central and wanchai . this time , due to time restraint , the only available hotel that we be able to book be in the kwun tong district . yes , the newton place hotel be just over a year old   nice facility for a   hotel but the location be not convenient for tourists . i would not recommend this hotel for those travel with kid and for those who intend to visit hk for shopping

my husband and i just return from a   day   night stay at the newton place hotel . even if the hotel be somewhat far from the tourist area , hongkong have a very efficient mtr . newton place be in an industrialize area with not much to see and do but it be compensate by its clean rooms and surroundings . it have very helpful and courteous staff . the hotel provide free shuttle service to a few mall nearby and to harbour city very near the star ferry

my family stay there for   nites and it be fun . our room be overlook the old airport . location be just fine since everything in hk be accessible . the mtr and the bus , mall .     be just a few block away . though its locate at an industrial zone , hotel be clean be roomy
