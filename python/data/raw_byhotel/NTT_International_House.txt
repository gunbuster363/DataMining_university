stay at the ntt house in december     in a so call suite with my family . it be   hkd per night , that be around   euro , not too cheap for university dorm . the suite be rather nice , but the kitchen be very worn down and under equipped just three plate and four different cups    thats all ! ! ! , only with fridge and microwave    not too useful    what be reason for my low grade , be two things   firstly , they have very strict rule about house rule , but no one seem to enforce this rule , as the noise in other rooms and in the hallway be untorelable especially during late night hours and no one reacts if you make a complaint   secondly , if you be not chinese , you have problem communicate with staff , as their english be basic at best , and thirdly , tv program be almost all in chinese , expect of two program that be part english and several non interesting     international    programms bloomberg , deutsche welle , rai . they could do a lot better offering more english base tv chanells . not everybody be chinese !

this accommodation be a university college residence , but considerably nicer than most dorm i â € ™ have be expose to when i be in school . stay at a place like this help for budget traveler as it be cheaper , but still â € ¦  you be pay about     can night for a university dorm set
