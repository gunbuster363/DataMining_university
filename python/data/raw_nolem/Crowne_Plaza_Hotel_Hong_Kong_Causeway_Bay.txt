i was not sure if i shoud book a room in this hotel , bacause of lack of opinions - I found only two of them. Today - I am sure that it was great decision - nice , well equipped , modern and new room was a nice surprice. Frendly staff and great view from roof-bar was the same like photos presented .

not too pricy in terms of 5 stars hotels in Hong Kong .

the hotel is 4.5 star , nicer than I thought a Crowne Plaza would be perhaps they 've upgraded the brand . Although the lobby is small and modest , the rooms are plenty roomy , and that includes the bathroom too. Everything is brand new at this time , and the service is excellent to boot .

i 've stayed at several hotels in the Causeway Bay area , and I must say that my stay at the new Crowne Plaza is the best one yet ! It 's quite new , opened just 2 weeks ago , so everything is still fresh .

we had a pleasant stay there. The room and service were great. The location was good , very close to Times Square where they are plenty of shopping and eating , and subway entrance. Good room size , very nice design with glass shower stall that can see through to the room but can be closed with wall panel for privacy. They were still working out a few minor kinks since it just opened but overall I would have given a 5 star if it were n't for the &quot ; scam&quot ; at checkout. When we checkout , the clerk asked if we 'd like to lock in the US $ rate so we do n't have to wait for our credit card to convert as the rate changes daily. We thought that would be good so we went ahead and accept their US rate. In hindsight , we should have asked what was the conversation rate they used. It turned out to be 7.47 , far from the average of 7.75. In fact , our credit card used 7.749. So do n't fall for that pitch about locking in your conversation rate ! ! ! That 's the only reason I gave a 3 start .
