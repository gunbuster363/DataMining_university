we had stayed 4 nites in this guesthouse , the owner clean our toilet and change the bedsheet daily. The guesths is located at 7floor. There is a security guard 24hrs sit at the ground floor with CCTV inside the lift. You will feel safe when u stay there. You can reach the Jordon MTR station just about 20 steps away from the guesths and the bus station just in front of the building. It was very convienient. No worry to family with children or single traveller , there is no &quot ; special service prostitutes &quot ; in this guesths. It is hardly to find a budgeted with good condition stays in HK !
