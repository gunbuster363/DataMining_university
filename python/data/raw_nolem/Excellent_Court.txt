i 'd stayed for 3 weeks in unit # D on an upper floor with a nice city view. I did n't experience any &quot ; bug&quot ; problem .

i would give five stars to the non-english speaking service staff and excellent location...but excellent kind of ends there...the air conditioning goes off periodically and there 's nothing you can do about it in the middle of a hot stuff tropical night. I was given a table fan the following day while the air was fixed. But what 's worse , is a trillion or more bugs chomping through your clothes. I have recently moved to Hong Kong , and was staying at this hotel for 4 weeks till I moved to my own appartment. Initially I noticed microcopic holes in my clothes , then 2 weeks later when I was separating my clothes for laundry I discovered almost all of them were severly bitten through to the point that they have been rendered useless to wear , either that or I wear these rags as a high-end fashion statement ! Fortunately it 's Hong Kong and tailors abound...all the same it 's expensive and my wallet is getting smaller...all the same alternatives for these rates HK $ 15000 abound if you book about 2/3 months in advance .
