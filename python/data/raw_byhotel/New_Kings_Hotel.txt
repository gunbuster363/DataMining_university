this hotel be locate in the yau ma tei area where there be many cheap hotel cheap relative to hong kong . we be please enough with what we receive for hk       a clean look decent foyer and reception , decent clean rooms , comfortable bed

we choose this hotel because of its location to mtr since we come in late at night and we have no reservations . we get the room at an expensive price but since we be tire , we check in

my friend gelo whom we meet in macau suggest new king 's hotel to stay , i check in with my friend for   from oct   the room be small but clean , bed be not that soft but could be a refuge after a day 's tire tour . toilet be clean with bathtub . the receptionist be cool and always ready to be of help for direction , limited english though . our room be daily fixed . the most advantageous part of the hotel be its location . convenient store around , bus stations steps away and the yau ma tei mtr be just   walk . for me it be a blessing i discover new king 's holtel , surely i will be back there

last month , i go to hongkong with my boyfriend for   nights . and we decide for a budget hotel that location be near mrt . so most of hotel that we look for be on nathan
