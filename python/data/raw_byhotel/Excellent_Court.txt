i 'd stay for   week in unit   would on an upper floor with a nice city view . i do n't experience any     bug    problem

i would give five star to the non english speak service staff and excellent location   but excellent kind of end there   the air condition go off periodically and there 's nothing you can do about it in the middle of a hot stuff tropical night . i be give a table fan the follow day while the air be fixed . but what 's worse , be a trillion or more bug chomp through your clothes . i have recently move to hong kong , and be stay at this hotel for   week till i move to my own appartment . initially i notice microcopic hole in my clothes , then   week later when i be separate my clothes for laundry i discover almost all of them be severly bitten through to the point that they have be render useless to wear , either that or i wear these rag as a high end fashion statement ! fortunately it 's hong kong and tailor abound   all the same it 's expensive and my wallet be get smaller   all the same alternative for these rates hk     abound if you book about   month in advance
