last leg of our macau hongkong trip . we move from dorsett hotel in tsuen wan , due to distance barrier to the city centre , in locate the place , we already have a hard time and be terribly shock by the atmosphere and the accommodation , believe it or not , the   nite stay we reserve and pay for in advance , ca n't convince us to stay , though we enter our room , and suddenly decide to pack our bag and leave    better to stay at home , rather than stay here in this junk hostel    be very wary , with fire exit , the place be so crowd , you might mistook this for a market place , though we be aware that hongkong rooms be relatively small .
