louie Business Hotel is smack in the middle of the shopping district at TST so a step beyond the building and everything you would ever need is at a arm 's length - literally ! The big shopping haven - Harbour Plaza is a couple of block 's walk , Kowloon Park is right across the street and oodles of shopping places right at your doorstep ! The TST MTR station is also only a few steps away so travelling is fast and easy .
