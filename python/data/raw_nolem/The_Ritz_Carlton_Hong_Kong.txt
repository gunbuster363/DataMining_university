my husband and I stayed in the Honeymoon Suite for our honeymoon - for five nights at the end of a long backpacking experience in China. We absolutely enjoyed it - outstanding , thus I am sad that it has been demolished considering we were hoping to return for another five night stay on our fifth wedding anniversary. The beautiful cocktails in the opulent Lounge listening to the live Jazz band is one of our happiest memories. The staff were absolutely beautiful. I bought many special items from the gift shop too which are a wonderful reminder of our honeymoon. The Ritz also started my obsession with Bvlgari toiletries...with an unlimited supply in our beautiful bathroom - how could one not fall in love with it ! I look forward to staying at the new Ritz !

how can rewiews continue to come in for recent stays at the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong , when that property in Central closed on January 1st , 2008 , and the former site was redeveloped into high rise office space ?

the rooms were way too small. Could barely fit 3 with all our luggage. The beds can sleep only one , they 're bigger than twin but smaller than queen and there is almost no space for an extra bed .

ritz Carlton Hong Kong has been demolished for over 2 years. How is it possible for reviews of stay as late as July 2009 ?

along with the Chedi in Muscat , the best hotel I have ever stayed in. What more can I say. A perfect stay in all regards .
