the hotel is mildly average. The rooms seem a little faded and the beds are terribly hard. I found flushing the toilet incredibly hard and a little strange , as we had to wait 20 minutes before we were able to flush. Still , there were some good things. There was internet in the lobby and check-in was fast. It 's quite a small hotel. If you want to come to Hong Kong , I would recommend staying in Kowloon or in the city of Hong Kong to feel the magic of HK. Unfortunately , the hotel was n't in the magic of Hong Kong. I would recommend this hotel for people stopping by in HK or budget travelers .

a nice , clean , relatively small hotel , and great for budget watchers. Not centrally located , but streetcar tram stops right out in front , and from there it 's only 10 minutes or so to MTR subway/rapid transit . Free internet access in the lobby is a plus. Rooms , at least those in the back , are pretty quiet .

the Cosco is a good standard , good value hotel in the western side of HK island. You can reach the centre , LKF and everywhere else quite easily on the tram for 12 pence 2 HK dollars , which takes about 10 minutes or so .

i would like to to say that I had a fantastic week in Hong Kong with the aid of a Rough Guide to Hong Kong ,
