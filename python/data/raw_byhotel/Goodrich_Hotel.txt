this be the right kind of hotel for a certain kind of traveller . this hotel be mean for those who be look for basic , clean , affordable , no frill accomodation in a convenient location

the service be terrible and room be super small . they have old guy at the front who be rude and even mean when i ask for a receipt on the last day when i leave    and never give me a receipt . they have prostitute stand in the front of the hotel and the pimp be a lady run a restaurant at the same corner , whom also know all the business on the street    it almost seem they be all     connected         i know for   us   per night in hk , i ca n't expect much but this be a hotel actually a motel i would never go back even as a single male traveler
