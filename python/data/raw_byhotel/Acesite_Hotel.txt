this hotel be what you would expect by     no frills    , not expect any service . the rooms be ok clean , the toilet be weird , when you flush the colour of the water isnt very pleasant , i think it use recycle water . also the towel have stain on them , so i recommend you bring your own . the toiletry be like sample pack size and i recommend to bring your own too

i book a triple sharing which come with a double bed plus a single bed from   till   very happy with the arrangement . the check in be fast

as the title suggest , this be a no frill , simple , basic hotel . in fact , it 's a commercial building turn hotel . when you be the footstep of the building , it resemble a typical old hk style office building lobby . to get to the hotel reception , you have to take the lift to next level
