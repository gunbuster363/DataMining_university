we stay at novotel across the road for a couple of days and the room be so small and stunk of smoke . we then go to chung hing across the road to see what it be like . yes it be an older building , but it 's cosy . we stay on the   floor . the room have great view , clean bathroom , comfortable bed . i be not sure why the other reviewer state that it be unacceptable and unclean . we find it clean , comfortable , awesome view and great location . good little eatery next door too for lunch . highly recommend this place . enjoy

this hotel be one to avoid . the hotel rooms and public area smell heavily of smoke . the room be small , dusty and smell strongly of cigarettes . the pillow on the bed have a bad smell as if they have not be washed . the bathroom be not very clean and smell of urine . fortunately only stay one night on a short package tour to china and hong kong . on make representation to hotel management about the problem , quite frankly the management do not want to know and be noisy and unsympathetic . the only good thing be its excellent locaton



we stay there   night with   rooms and we feel that it 's without air in all of   rooms . we have to open window and it become okay and better . inside of   rooms be not smell of cigarette . we stay   people in a room and extra bed could n't sleep . the elevator always strong cigarette smell everydays as well as no smoking written . the size of rooms be small and narrow . water 's also some smell but it 's so good strong . service be okay and location be good to close with jordan station mtr

i have have a bad experience while at hong kong recently and i ca n't help but feel cheat by the tour agent
